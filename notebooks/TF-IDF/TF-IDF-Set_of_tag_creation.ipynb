    "## Overview of TF-IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF (short for term frequency–inverse document frequency) is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tf–idf value increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document and is offset by the number of documents in the corpus that contain the word.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, words that are common in every document, such as \"this\", \"what\", and \"if\", rank low even though they may appear many times, since they don’t mean much to that document in particular. However, if the word \"Bug\" appears many times in a document, while not appearing many times in others, it probably means that it’s very relevant."
