I also couldn't say whether the other programs are \"doing it wrong\" or Firefox is the odd one out \u2014 at the moment I'm comparing to Google Chrome, but maybe that's got some built-in rendering mechanism that's bypassing Ubuntu's \"official\" rendering.

Note the extra hinting on the capital 'I' and on the dot on lower case 'i'. Other letters (eg. 'h', 'f') show some of it too. The hinting also seems to affect the kerning, resulting in slightly odd letter spacing. I see this in Gmail too. I don't see it on every site.\n</p><p>Note that I deliberately don't have the Microsoft fonts installed, but I have fallbacks defined in ~/.config/fontconfig/conf.d/00-aliases.conf.
